8:51	Restrict your question to one question per chat Okay with that said let's get.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=531
8:57	Into the questions Okay our first question of the.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=537
9:03	"Night is going to be coming from Joseph aptly named and he asks ""Did."	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=543
9:12	"Egyptians actually think the brain was useless?"" The answer to that is a surprisingly no They didn't think it was."	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=552
9:19	Useless They just weren't exactly sure what it did.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=559
9:25	Now why do we know this okay the reason why is because of surgical manuals Uh.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=565
9:31	And the particular surgical man manual is the Edwin Smith Papyrus So they did do surgery on the.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=571
9:39	Brain to repair certain things from happening For example they knew enough.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=579
9:45	About say the function of the brain that they could do tonation which is a kind.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=585
9:52	Of brain surgery where they open up a circle in the skull and remove part of the brain often a tumor So they they.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=592
10:00	Understood that when the brain malfunctioned the rest of the person was not healthy Okay So they didn't think.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=600
10:07	The brain was useless At the same time too there wasn't a.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=607
10:12	Practical way to extract the brain for say um.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=612
10:19	Mummification So in that respect they needed to.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=619
10:25	Do when they when they mummified a body they couldn't take the brain out.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=625
10:30	So what ended up happening was usually that the brain was left in the skull and as the mummy dehydrated it just formed a.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=630
10:38	Film inside the skull So.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=638
10:44	"Uh Gabe Reagan says ""I don't know if I trust Bronze Age brain."	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=644
10:50	"Surgery."" Yeah but their patients survived we got lots of examples of of skulls."	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=650
10:57	Where they had performed tponation and it started.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=657
11:03	Healing over you know there's evidence of the blood bone starting to knit back up so even though as as I said.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=663
11:12	Very crude I and I wouldn't trust it myself but they it was an effective.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=672
11:21	Treatment when it was targeting the right place.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=681
11:29	"So Mama says ""Wow I always thought that they did the hook through the nose."	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=689
11:35	"Mashup thing."" No And they that was a myth for a long time Uh many many people."	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=695
11:41	Still believe it today In fact many Egyptologists still believe it But recent studies have shown that they.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=701
11:49	Didn't go up the nose with a hook or anything like that what they did was they just left it there Um the problem.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=709
11:56	Was that when 19th century Europeans started cutting open.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=716
12:02	Mummies they couldn't find a brain in it But that's they've they've now looked.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=722
12:07	Using using MRIs They can now see the film of the brain that aderes to the.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=727
12:14	Side of the skull So yeah the whole the whole idea that.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=734
12:19	They went up the nose with a hook and drained out the brain is a myth Okay Um.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=739
12:25	But it's again this is this is these are recent findings These are recent findings that have shown that the that.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=745
12:30	They just didn't do anything with the.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=750
12:40	Brain Um where's that okay I see that 811.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=760
12:47	Okay Michael Price did they know about the use of metal plates to counter infection naturally apparently they.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=767
12:53	Didn't They didn't use metal plates which was not sure what they used but we.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=773
13:00	Don't see any evidence of metal plates or any replacement for the skull So they.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=780
13:06	Would cut it open and just I don't know if they they sewed it back over or what It's not clear exactly what sort of.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=786
13:14	Post-operative treatment they did but they don't seem to have used metal plates.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=794
13:21	Here Yeah Yeah Um it's possible they left it open It's possible they just sewed the skin in shut We don't know We.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=801
13:29	Don't know exactly how they did it but they don't seem to have used a.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=809
13:35	Metal plate Okay.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=815
13:43	Uh nor wood There's no evidence that they used wood or.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=823
13:48	Either in fact again the evidence seems to be that the that the bone.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=828
13:54	Started to actually knit across the wound So if you have a metal plate there.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=834
13:59	That would interfere with with the knitting it So it doesn't appear to be any sort of of.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=839
14:05	Um filler substance there So they just they just left it Again they might have.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=845
14:12	Covered the sewn up the skin over it but once they sewed up the skin over it they sort of just left.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=852
14:20	It Okay So I think that covers the question So they did think that the that.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=860
14:27	The brain had a use They just didn't know what it.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=867
14:32	Was Okay Okay the next question here is from Harry Stark and he asks a personal.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=872
14:39	Question After David told his secular friends he was a Christian were there any of them surprised what are you a.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=879
14:46	Christian no They're okay I never really told friends I was a.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=886
14:53	Christian Um it sort of just came up in casually in conversation So there wasn't any huge.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=893
15:01	Like I'm a Christian guys No no no I didn't do that Okay And it's not.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=901
15:09	Like I didn't talk religion with my secular friends Okay It was just just.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=909
15:15	Sort of came up naturally So there there wasn't a there wasn't any.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=915
15:21	Sort of shocking revelation there for them to.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=921
15:26	Gasp you know you know you know you know we'd be.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=926
15:32	Sitting around a a fire somewhere and you know yeah we we'd talk about you know do you believe in God yeah sure.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=932
15:40	Some of them said nah no not me It just it would just it would just be like that.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=940
15:45	Where it would just just came up casually.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=945
15:51	So you know not everything has to be a a.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=951
15:57	Um a dramatic monologue [Laughter].	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=957
16:07	Moment This is like Yeah No no I mean too many people live their life with.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=967
16:12	Drama anyway You know why does everything have to be a moment of drama of drama.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=972
16:23	Okay you know if you don't present something with drama people are not going are less likely to respond with.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=983
16:29	Drama Okay Just saying Just saying.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=989
16:39	Yeah Okay So yeah when my when my friends.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=999
16:45	Found out I was Christian it wasn't a surprise Um it just wasn't an issue.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1005
16:51	Though either So hope that helps answer that.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1011
16:58	Question Now I will say one time it was a surprise Okay I will mention one.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1018
17:04	Person to whom it was a surprise Um there was a guy when I was working at Tap Pharmaceuticals whom I.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1024
17:11	Used to play chess with Okay And this guy was was one of those.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1031
17:19	Um say this He would be what we would call today a blue sky.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1039
17:25	Liberal Okay He was as as liberal as it came I mean far-left.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1045
17:33	Liberal and you know we we talked and you know eventually it turned to things.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1053
17:38	Like religion and stuff and you know he was I had managed to beat him four games.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1058
17:44	Out of five in chess and finally he asked me the question you.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1064
17:51	Know it's like you're you're smart and you're a Christian it's like.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1071
18:00	"[Laughter] Yes He's like ""You're really."	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1080
18:07	"Smart."" Yes I don't see how that could that's."	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1087
18:12	Mutually exclusive to being Christian But hey he was surprised He was really.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1092
18:20	Surprised because he had such a low view of Christians that he think that he thought that no no Christian would be.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1100
18:28	Smart enough to beat him at chess let alone do that four out of five.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1108
18:39	Times Yeah he was surprised But hey.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1119
18:49	That's the only person I I can think of that was really really shocked.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1129
18:56	He was also stunned I beat him a chest too Yeah.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1136
19:03	Okay So yeah nobody's been surprised who's who's known me for any length of.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1143
19:09	Time Uh except for that one guy Okay Next question here comes from.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1149
19:17	"Mobius Uh and he asks ""Considering how far back in time the history of Jericho."	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1157
19:22	Goes isn't it odd that nothing from Abraham to Jacob mentions.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1162
19:27	"It?"" Well that's actually not surprising Um Jericho was really a a."	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1167
19:38	A fortress that guarded the fords of the Jordan That was its purpose.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1178
19:45	It was to prevent entry across the forts Okay And a fort is basically a low point.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1185
19:52	In the river where you can cross on foot Okay Uh at Jericho there it it's it's.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1192
20:00	Right near those forts So it was Jericho was set up there.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1200
20:05	To prevent people from coming in into Canaan.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1205
20:11	Okay Through that entry port Okay Uh Abraham and Jacob didn't come through.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1211
20:18	The fords of the of of the Jordan Okay they came north from the north.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1218
20:24	Through Syria At least Abraham did And Jacob was inside of Canaan.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1224
20:31	Already Um so neither Abraham nor Jacob ever had to.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1231
20:39	Cross the fords of the Jordan Okay because they never had to cross the fords of the Jordan There would have.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1239
20:45	Been no reason for them to have encountered Jericho So it was just not not near the.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1245
20:52	Anywhere where they were sort of sojurning You wouldn't take your flocks.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1252
20:57	There I mean Jordan would be a horrible place to take flocks Uh so you know there's just no.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1257
21:04	Reason for them to go to Jericho.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1264
21:13	So so you know it's it's not surprising that they didn't talk about I mean I.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1273
21:18	Mean Abraham sort of he was more around Hebron than than.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1278
21:23	Than Jericho So this is why they talk more about Hebrron.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1283
21:29	Too because they're going to be in areas both the patriarchs are going to be.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1289
21:35	Living in areas where your pasture flocks and Jericho is just not that place Okay so I hope that helps Thank.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1295
21:43	You for the question Very much appreciate it Okay the next question here is.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1303
21:52	"Uh from Mary Stark and this will be the last known super chat for the beginning segment here and he asks ""Have book."	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1312
21:59	"Critics said anything about the novel?"" Yes one book critic has Um there was a."	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1319
22:06	Book critic on Twitter who you know.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1326
22:12	Basically he he does he he does book reviews of Christian.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1332
22:19	Fiction and he had reviewed my book at the same time as he reviewed a.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1339
22:25	Book by Shirley Johnson and John Delaros Okay.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1345
22:33	And oh he had very high praise for it He had very high praise for it.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1353
22:38	Uh yeah it's it is it is the one we posted in the community post Um yep.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1358
22:44	That's the one Uh yeah I've been asked to read it Okay.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1364
22:50	So you can always go back and read this yourself but it is a very very funny review.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1370
22:57	So he titles this reviews of novels that you as a Christian can enjoy and.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1377
23:02	Give your youngans That's fair enough He says I.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1382
23:08	Read Reloy of the Dead by Dr David A Faulk Overall a delightful novel Also.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1388
23:13	One that gives me an excuse to talk about two potential pitfalls in pi in fiction writing.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1393
23:20	The first is that specialists in any field other than fiction writing tend.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1400
23:25	Not to make very good fiction writers I agree with him totally here I've read some novels by.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1405
23:32	Um academic writers and they're awful normally Okay He says they tend to be.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1412
23:38	Didactic regarding their field of interest and not very convincing in terms of character and plot They also.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1418
23:45	Tend to be narrowly educated in their field with little experience or knowledge to inform other elements of.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1425
23:51	Their story resulting in glaring plot holes and technical.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1431
23:57	Mistakes Dr Faulk divi delightfully averts this.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1437
24:02	Trope demonstrating passible knowledge in a wide range of subjects need for a.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1442
24:08	Story which is a space exploration adventure with aliens Well part of the.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1448
24:13	Reason why I'm able to avoid this is I actually did fiction writing long before.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1453
24:19	I did academic w So I've been writing fiction since my.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1459
24:26	Teens So and I didn't get into the into doing academic work until my 30s So.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1466
24:33	I've been writing fiction for decades prior to my ever getting into uh.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1473
24:39	"Academia So that's one of the reasons why I was able to avoid that He continues ""Color me surprised An."	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1479
24:48	Outer space ancient aliens romp from an actual Egyptologist and it's actually.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1488
24:54	Good and fun and not bogged down by attempts to.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1494
24:59	"Teach us all how much everyone else gets wrong about ancient Egypt."" And I concur."	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1499
25:04	You know that wouldn't be fun In fact there's almost no ancient Egypt in it This is a good thing on Dr Folk's.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1504
25:12	Part especially for a Dave Bume novel It frees him to do what all.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1512
25:18	Fiction writers do write as non-PhDs based on research but with a focus on.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1518
25:23	Character plot and fun which is the point You know to introduce people to.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1523
25:29	Archaeology in a manner that's fun Okay.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1529
25:34	He then goes on which leads me to another phenomenon.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1534
25:41	That tends to plague fiction writers Their sense of human psychology tends to be.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1541
25:47	Autobiographical The famous example of this is Lord of the Flies depicting the breakdown into savagery and tribalism of.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1547
25:53	Young boys on a resourcerich island Build as an insightful indictment.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1553
25:59	Of human nature It really ends up being an insightful window into the author's.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1559
26:05	Nature And meanwhile a group of actual school boys gets stranded on an island for.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1565
26:11	Months and has prayer every night and takes care of its members until dramafree.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1571
26:17	Rescue The human condition is widely varied and authors write what they know.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1577
26:23	They write as if all people are the kind of people with whom they are familiar.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1583
26:29	Apparently the kind of people Dr Faulk knows are.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1589
26:35	A-holes Well.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1595
26:40	"Um he goes ""Our protagonist and every character he encounters are socially."	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1600
26:45	"Inept backstabbing children in adult bodies."" Okay now not everyone I know is."	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1605
26:53	An a-hole okay but I did encounter an awful lot of them Especially when I.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1613
26:59	Worked in IT when I worked in corporate America it was much much it was just.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1619
27:06	Comical how many uh socially inept backstabbing.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1626
27:12	"Children and adult bodies I encountered Then he asks ""Is academia of."	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1632
27:20	"Ancient Egypt really so backbiting?"" Um not so much Egyptology although there's."	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1640
27:26	Some of that Uh theology Oh yeah Oh yeah.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1646
27:31	In in theology and Christian seminaries oh yeah academia is that bite.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1651
27:37	Biting We must presume so And wonder if Dr Faulk needs a hug.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1657
27:43	Yes I need a hug That said while the entire cast are.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1663
27:49	Steadfastly unlikable we yet manage to come to like the protagonist and his loyal assistant Gunhand and root for.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1669
27:56	Them The level of character development here is on par for commercial fiction but entertainingly.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1676
28:04	Idiosyncratic Dr Folk proposes that to resolve a politically sensitive and.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1684
28:10	Technically demanding crisis in a space colony on the verge of collapse you need a man with a particular set of skills.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1690
28:17	And those are the skills of a socially inept Egyptologist And yet he just about pulls.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1697
28:24	It off at least well enough to keep us entertained and intrigued by his particular twist on the ancient alien.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1704
28:31	Concept Lastly given the abrupt ending expect a.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1711
28:36	Series which is true The second book is already in pre-order Entertaining And it concludes.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1716
28:43	Here Entertaining thoughtprovoking educational minimal bad language and no lascivious content Fit for Christian.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1723
28:50	Audiences Enjoy.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1730
28:55	Okay So that was one critic that who who reviewed my book and and it was a very.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1735
29:02	Positive review So yes.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1742
29:08	Uh we have had one critic review the book but only one so far But it was a very very positive.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1748
29:15	Review In fact all the all the reviews we've gotten so far have been extremely positive.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1755
29:25	Uh Warrior of the Most High Wait a minute So this book is actually your take on ancient.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1765
29:30	Aliens yes sort of.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1770
29:37	Yes And why not you know why not.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1777
29:42	Bc I'm not saying it was aliens but hey if you're going to do an ancient.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1782
29:49	Alien twist you know why why not i mean it's as as long as you you don't think it's real And I don't think I don't.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1789
29:56	Think the whole ancient alien thing is real but you know why not explore that.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1796
30:02	As well what if it were real you know how could how would that play into man's.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1802
30:09	Explorations to the stars it could be very very.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1809
30:16	Interesting Okay So we have had as I said one critic review it and review.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1816
30:23	It very positively So we're very thankful for.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1823
30:29	That But here's the thing Um as long as you're able to separate fiction from.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1829
30:34	Reality yeah I don't mind I don't mind entertaining the possibility as a sort.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1834
30:39	Of a fictional well what.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1839
30:45	If I think that's perfectly appropriate and perfectly okay But don't confuse it.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1845
30:52	For.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1852
30:59	Reality Yeah Dossman says Stargate is a fun movie not a documentary.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1859
31:06	Exactly Exactly It's not a documentary It's a fun movie.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1866
31:11	Though And I can I can appreciate movies that that that take that ancient aliens.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1871
31:16	Concept and play with it just on a matter of.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1876
31:22	Fiction but I would never say that aliens built the pyramids I mean I think that would that's.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1882
31:28	Stupid So it's like but you know there are there are.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1888
31:34	Other ways you could play with the ancient alien concept and produce an intriguing kind of science fiction.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1894
31:41	From it So and that's where we go with this this this series of novels Um are.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1901
31:47	Ancient aliens kind of more border on not only alien races but also.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1907
31:54	Spirit critters too Yeah we'll talk about more of this on Wednesday when we actually do the.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1914
32:01	Live stream on this Okay so let's get back to our questions here Our first super chat here is from.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1921
32:11	Uh Joseph for $2 Thank you for the super chat book recommendations for NT use of.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1931
32:17	The Old Testament Unfortunately I don't have one.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1937
32:22	Um there was supposed to be one that sounded really good at least in its premise that was.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1942
32:29	Supposed to be a cooperative effort between DA Carson and Treer.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1949
32:35	Longman the third It for some reason just never went off I don't know what happened with that.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1955
32:42	I had heard that there was an agreement between the two to produce a book that say went through.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1962
32:52	Um the New Testament and sort of ask the question you know how does it how do.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1972
33:00	These New Testament passages reference the Old Testament and for some bizarre reason.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1980
33:07	The project never never went to fruition So I don't know if it was a fact that.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1987
33:13	They couldn't get funding to complete it or what but.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1993
33:18	Um it just never happened It just never happened And that's I think it's really unfortunate cuz that could have been a.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=1998
33:24	Really good resource but unfortunately I don't know if it was turning out.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=2004
33:31	Too long or somebody bowed out Um it could have been Longman who who bowed.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=2011
33:37	Out of this because I heard he hasn't he had sort of some sketchy health.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=2017
33:42	Issues at that time So but I don't think there's anyone who's done a really really good job of.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=2022
33:48	This so far but there might be some some.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=2028
33:54	Uh some other resources available out there that could help on this but I don't happen to know any off the top of my.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=2034
34:00	Head Okay So thank you very much for the super.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=2040
34:05	Chat but that's about the best I could do unfortunately It needs to happen though It needs to.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=2045
34:12	Happen Okay Andrew Tinsley for $10 Thank you for the super.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=2052
34:17	Chat What would have the Israelites have done during the 40 years in the desert.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=2057
34:23	Mana would mean they didn't have to work much for food That's actually not true But.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=2063
34:28	Uh would it be boring enough to be worse than slavery in Egypt okay They still.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=2068
34:37	Had to work for food Um it's kind of a myth that you know the mana just came.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=2077
34:42	And that's all they ate Um their diet did not just consist of of.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=2082
34:50	Mana Now they did eat a lot of mana And there was an actually an I heard.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=2090
34:57	There was an interesting proposal for what was mana.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=2097
35:05	Um a micologist just recently talked about the desert truffle which is a kind of fungus that.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=2105
35:11	Appears out on in savas Um and and I had thought when I.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=2111
35:18	When I read the the the wandering in the desert in the mana that it it.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=2118
35:24	Sounded a lot like fungus Anyway and the fact that somebody has identified a.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=2124
35:30	Fungus that behaves like this I think is incredibly.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=2130
35:36	Interesting Okay Now with that said.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=2136
35:43	Um these people are not just sitting around collecting mana okay yes they.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=2143
35:48	Are out there collecting mana and it's work okay it's work but they still have flocks to to to feed flocks to f to tend.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=2148
35:58	They have to go to drive their flocks to water and to silage They're still working okay.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=2158
36:06	They're not they're not sitting on their hands okay just because mana is feeding them doesn't mean they have they they.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=2166
36:12	They can just let the flock starve So they're still working They're.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=2172
36:18	Still making tents They're still making still making clothes.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=2178
36:24	Yep They they have to still do the things of life Okay.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=2184
36:31	So so it might not be as interesting as living in Egypt but they still had a.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=2191
36:39	Lot of work They kept busy Okay So.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=2199
36:46	Um it's it's not a life of boredom It's it's a life of tedium And that's.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=2206
36:52	Probably a better way of saying it.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=2212
37:04	"Yep Um Dark Blade asks ""Uh would there have been regular sacrifices during the wandering period?"" There would have been."	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=2224
37:11	Some sacrifices because you do have say the.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=2231
37:16	Tabernacle So as long as the tabernacle was set up there'd be sacrifices So.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=2236
37:29	Um what do you make of the verse that says their gear didn't wear out i wouldn't take that as an absolute.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=2249
37:36	Okay It's more along the lines that God was kept supplying them in gear.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=2256
37:44	Okay So it was like it didn't wear out because there was always replacements.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=2264
37:49	Okay It's not that that they went out with one set of shoes and 40 years later.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=2269
37:57	Entered the promised land with the same set of shoes Okay it's not like.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=2277
38:02	That It's more like that the Lord kept providing along the way Okay so they.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=2282
38:09	Didn't suffer loss as they wandered out into the wilderness Okay.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=2289
38:17	So so I think I think that's a lot of it is it's it's it's an it's a naive.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=2297
38:25	Reading to say that the that the that their clothes and their their shoes just didn't wear out at all Okay It's as I.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=2305
38:33	Said it's more that the Lord provided along the way So it is like if as if it.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=2313
38:39	Didn't wear out Okay.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=2319
38:48	"U Mr Petups asks ""Do you take the number of 40 years to be historical or."	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=2328
38:53	"Allegorical?"" I take it to be approximate Okay Um I think I think the."	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=2333
39:00	When you start talking about 40 years because it's an idiomatic number I think.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=2340
39:05	It gets really sort of dodgy whether or not it's an exact 40.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=2345
39:12	Years Um but at the same time too from the historical records it does seem to.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=2352
39:19	Be close to 40 years Whether it's 38 or 42 we're not sure but I wouldn't take it.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=2359
39:26	As an exact number Um I think it'd be a mistake to again overread an idiom as.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=2366
39:34	Say an exact number So I wouldn't take this here.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=2374
39:39	As either allegorical or historical but I'd take it as idiomatic which means it.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=2379
39:46	It could be close but not necessarily exact.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=2386
39:52	All right I think that covers that question that super.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=2392
39:57	Chat So overall yeah they still worked They still worked It just was.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=2397
40:03	Tending their flocks and basically building tents and that sort of.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=2403
40:10	Thing Yeah it was it was very similar to the work they were doing in Egypt Less mud bricks though.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=2410
40:21	All right next super chat here from Andrew Tinsley for $5 Thank you for the super chat Do we know ancient any other.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=2421
40:29	Ancient Egyptian king ancient Neareastern kings who had as many wives as.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=2429
40:34	Solomon yes we do Uh [Laughter].	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=2434
40:40	Ramse's Yeah Ramse's had that many wives.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=2440
40:46	Um here's the thing Uh Ramse's had or sorry Solomon had 700.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=2446
40:52	Wives and 300 concubines.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=2452
40:59	Now here's the thing A concubine is technically not a wife but a slave that.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=2459
41:08	Is there for pleasure purposes Okay.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=2468
41:15	So wives were generally done exchanged.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=2475
41:21	Between kings for daughters would be chain exchanged between kings to be.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=2481
41:27	Treaty wives So most of these wives would have been as a result of of.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=2487
41:34	Cutting treaties and then the concubines was kind of thrown in as bonuses Okay So.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=2494

47:01	Chat is from off Oscar Fellow for $10 Romanian.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=2821
47:11	"Thank you for the super chat He says ""My sister has come back to Christ and is taking her children to."	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=2831
47:18	"Church."" Praise the Lord for that This has led to receive spiritual attacks and seeing shadowy figures Kids."	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=2838
47:26	Are scared Prayers are appreciated Any recommendations okay two.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=2846
47:32	Recommendations One praise God Keep praising God Um demonic entities do not.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=2852
47:39	Like praise Praise of God So if you praise God if you praise Christ and if.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=2859
47:46	These are really spirit entities they will be driven off Okay Now that's the.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=2866
47:51	First piece of advice Let's say that doesn't work though Okay If that doesn't.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=2871
47:58	Work then you also have to look at the alternatives too which is that sometimes.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=2878
48:06	Uh people seeing demonic figures is a result of a.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=2886
48:12	Medical issue Okay and we can't overlook that Okay we do know that some uh.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=2892
48:20	Medications cause people to see shadowy figures We do know that sleep.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=2900
48:25	Paralysis can cause people to see what is demonic entities Um there was even a.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=2905
48:34	Case where a guy had suffered a kind of epilepsy.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=2914
48:39	Now in this particular kind of epilepsy he kept seeing demons.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=2919
48:45	Everywhere he went and he was he underwent.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=2925
48:52	Um exorcisms and nothing worked Okay Um and they couldn't figure out what it was.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=2932
48:59	Until he had an MRI and they discovered he was having these these microepileptic seizures that wasn't.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=2939
49:05	Causing him to show physical seizures But it was causing him to hallucinate.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=2945
49:12	And see demons everywhere he went Okay Now that was ultimately treated with.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=2952
49:18	Medication Okay So but everywhere he went he saw demons and they seemed.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=2958
49:26	Real So it his condition is very.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=2966
49:33	Rare but it these things do happen So as I said again don't just do one medical.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=2973
49:41	Or the spiritual here Do both If they if your if you and your.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=2981
49:48	Kids your sister's your sister and her kids praise God with praise music prayer.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=2988
49:55	All that and goes away fantastic Problem solved If it doesn't go away look at.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=2995
50:03	Those other alternatives too okay because you don't want to be scared about this Uh it doesn't do any good to.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=3003
50:10	Be scared and if it's a medical condition it can be treated Okay so.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=3010
50:16	Again that's what I would suggest here is you do both Do the praise see if that that.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=3016
50:22	Works If it doesn't work yeah then look at the other issues say on the more uh.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=3022

58:12	Yeah Um as my producer here points out that if if if anything didn't come true.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=3492

1:01:39	Now this whole thing about ruling over the having dominion over the birds.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=3699
1:01:46	And the fish essentially the whole idea of of.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=3706
1:01:52	Genesis and say the created order is.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=3712
1:01:58	That the world was created this untamed wilderness Okay It was tamed untamed and.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=3718
1:02:06	Wild Okay And God made man to have dominion.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=3726
1:02:12	Or rulership over it Why to turn it into.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=3732
1:02:17	A garden essentially It seems that God's idea.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=3737
1:02:24	Of perfect world order is like the.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=3744
1:02:29	Garden of Eden a carefully tended garden Instead of say a wild wild planet.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=3749
1:02:39	God was intending man to basically show his dominion over it to make it more.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=3759
1:02:46	Like Eden Okay so Eden is the template for the world.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=3766
1:02:53	Okay so Eden's the template Man's supposed to copy.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=3773
1:02:59	Eden He's supposed to take Eden and copy it everywhere Now what is Eden like.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=3779
1:03:07	We're not exactly sure but that's essentially what he's supposed to do Is.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=3787
1:03:13	He supposed to have show his dominion in the same way that God had dominion over.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=3793
1:03:21	Eden BC were supposed to be victorious over chaos Exactly Yeah.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=3801
1:03:33	"Yeah Yeah Exactly And Grims goes ""Which is not the view naturalists would hold."	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=3813
1:03:38	"To."" Exactly Yeah They're saying ""Yeah naturalists would hold that chaos."	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=3818
1:03:44	"Is good."" So but that doesn't seem to be God's plan for the world God's plan for."	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=3824
1:03:51	The world is to bring order to the earth Order to the world to to Now now with.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=3831
1:03:58	That said it's not to exterminate life either Okay it's not to basically.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=3838
1:04:06	Um how do I say this destroy species Okay there is there is an aspect here of.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=3846
1:04:13	Creation care where God gives creation to mankind and then mankind is supposed.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=3853
1:04:20	To to nurture and cultivate creation Okay.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=3860
1:04:29	So so I hope you know that that that we we learn from that edenic.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=3869
1:04:37	Experience But it is an edenic experience that is supposed to be.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=3877
1:04:42	Nurtured and cultured into a semblance of of edenic.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=3882
1:04:47	Order.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=3887
1:04:53	So so it's not naturalism but it's also not industrialism either.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=3893
1:05:00	It's sort of a a a happy middle.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=3900
1:05:06	Ground where man and nature are sort of.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=3906
1:05:12	Uh man is caring for nature so that nature can propagate grow and be orderly.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=3912
1:05:19	Within say the Edenic context Okay.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=3919
1:05:26	Though that's the meaning of dominion over the fish and birds in Genesis 1:28.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=3926
1:05:32	It is to to cultivate the order of creation So I hope that helps Thank you.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=3932

1:05:59	Chat Genesis 39 8:9 is the sin Joseph is talking about adultery or abusing the.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=3959
1:06:05	Blessings he has been given Okay let's go to Genesis.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=3965
1:06:14	38 8 to 9 Okay.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=3974
1:06:24	39 Sorry 39 Yeah Time for the AT show Yeah.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=3984
1:06:31	Exactly We used to have a Bon Bon show Now we have an AT ministry.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=3991
1:06:37	Show I know Bon Bon's hanging out here So.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=3997
1:06:44	Okay Uh chapter 39 verse8 But he refused and.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=4004
1:06:49	"Said to his master's wife ""Behold with with me here my master."	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=4009
1:06:56	Does not concern himself with anything of the house and he has put all that he owns in my charge There is no one.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=4016
1:07:02	Greater in this house than I and he has withheld nothing from me except you Because you are his wife how then.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=4022
1:07:11	"Could I do this great evil and sin against God?""."	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=4031
1:07:16	Okay He is talking about adultery here Okay Um and it's abuse of trust It's.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=4036
1:07:24	Essentially an abuse of trust So there is both that going on here Um abuse of trust and uh.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=4044
1:07:33	Basically adultery All right So he's basically saying to to.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=4053
1:07:41	Potterer's wife you know the master's been good to me He's put me in charge of.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=4061
1:07:48	Everything Why would I abuse that trust you know by committing adultery.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=4068
1:07:55	Okay so Joseph here is talking adultery but he's also talking about an.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=4075
1:08:00	Abuse of trust And so while there was no say formal law on the books about adultery it was still.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=4080
1:08:09	Thought as being wrong.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=4089
1:08:14	So So it does seem to be a it's not an abuse of the blessings it's an abuse of.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=4094
1:08:19	Trust Uh there's also the Egyptian angle to.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=4099
1:08:24	This as well which is crossing social.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=4104
1:08:31	Strata from sort of the Egyptian sort of flip side of this The Egyptian view would have much.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=4111
1:08:37	More because Joseph's a slave.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=4117
1:08:43	Okay Um because Joseph is a slave the Egyptian side of this would see this as.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=4123
1:08:52	Being a violation of the social strata Yeah So that would be very a very.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=4132
1:09:00	Serious thing Um women in in Egypt committed adultery all the time Okay Usually that.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=4140
1:09:08	Ended in divorce but when there was a violation of the social strata.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=4148
1:09:14	Uh things penalties could get much more severe So there's that going on too that.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=4154
1:09:22	This is not only adultery and a violation of trust but it's also.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=4162
1:09:29	A a a shame offense because the wife of a high.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=4169
1:09:37	Officer of the court is doing it with a slave And that's a violation of the.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=4177
1:09:44	Social strata and Egyptian society looked very very poorly on.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=4184
1:09:51	That much more so than adultery in general So I hope that helped Thank you.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=4191
1:09:58	Very much for the super chat Very much appreciate it Okay next one here from 18 ministries.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=4198
1:10:06	From 199 Thank you for the super chat Genesis 32:12 What garment would he have worn.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=4206
1:10:13	"All right 32:12 And it says ""They caught him by his."	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=4213
1:10:20	"Garment saying ""Lie with me."" And he left his garment in her hand and fled and went out."	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=4220
1:10:28	Okay Um sometimes Egyptians wore linen robes.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=4228
1:10:35	Okay Uh particularly important overseers would would wear these Okay and is is.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=4235
1:10:41	Just more or less looks kind of like let's say this looks a little bit like a house.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=4241
1:10:46	Coat but they're they're light linen Okay they're meant to be cool You just.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=4246
1:10:51	It's something you just wrap around yourself cuz it could get cold at night and it keep you warm at night cool in.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=4251
1:10:59	The day So that's what what they're talking about here is essentially a very light.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=4259
1:11:07	Linen robe essentially Okay So that's the garment.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=4267
1:11:15	She's talking about here So I hope that helps.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=4275
1:11:21	Um there is the possibility to it could have been his kilt All.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=4281
1:11:28	Right that's a possibility too And in some ways that's the more likely.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=4288
1:11:36	Possibility because every overseer would have wear worn a kilt Um a lot of.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=4296
1:11:42	Egyptians wore kilts So he might have fled.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=4302
1:11:49	Naked Okay that's possible.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=4309
1:11:55	In which case if she shows his kilt to.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=4315
1:12:01	Um to Potterer that's not a good look That's really not a good.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=4321
1:12:08	Look because it means he got undressed Um.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=4328
1:12:16	Yeah Din Egyptian streaking Yeah.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=4336
1:12:25	So I would say given given the context here given I mean it doesn't say a.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=4345
1:12:32	Robe here It says a garment So just a covering of some.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=4352
1:12:39	Kind Okay So it's not this is not probably not a loin cloth It's probably a.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=4359
1:12:45	Kilt But still again a robe could be possible here.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=4365
1:12:53	But I think kilts is the more likely likely thing And all men of of status.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=4373
1:12:59	War wore kilts Even slaves who have had sla status war kilts See low low.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=4379
1:13:08	Um low status slaves would wear loin.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=4388
1:13:13	Cloths but higher status slaves would wear kilts.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=4393
1:13:21	So that's and they were knotted in the front by the.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=4401
1:13:26	Way Yeah So parts didn't.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=4406
1:13:33	Show I don't know This is not a sexual thing It's just hot.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=4413
1:13:40	Yeah Okay So that's probably what it's meant here by what garment he wore It's probably the.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=4420
1:13:46	Kilt Okay Okay next one from AT.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=4426
1:13:52	[Laughter] Ministries Uh Dossman my new conspiracy.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=4432
1:13:59	Scottish Egyptians Well yeah they both wore kilts.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=4439
1:14:06	Uh Scots tended to wear a lot more than just the kilt though.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=4446

1:15:03	Here Okay Uh key I.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=4503

1:16:04	I hate for I hate divorce says the Lord I would have to look up look this all up.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=4564
1:16:09	In alexagons to give you a decent Yeah there's something hicky about.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=4569
1:16:16	This.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=4576
1:16:23	Um I hate shellock sending Okay it's using an.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=4583
1:16:29	Idiom here It's using an idiom Uh for I hate sending away is what it says.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=4589
1:16:39	Um that's probably an idiom for divorce or I hate sending away and.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=4599
1:16:48	That's an idiom for divorce Um says the Lord a God of.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=4608
1:16:55	Israel and the covering of.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=4615
1:17:02	Violence Um the.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=4622
1:17:09	Garment says the Lord of hosts.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=4629
1:17:17	And keeping on the wind.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=4637
1:17:25	Spirit Okay.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=4645
1:17:33	Yeah Okay So in in verse 16 here it it uses an a euphemism here for I hate.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=4653
1:17:41	Hate divorce And it's basically I hate the putting away And that's that's a euphemism for divorce says the Lord God.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=4661
1:17:46	Of Israel and him who covers his garment with wrong says the Lord.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=4666
1:17:54	Um it's it's a very it's that that second passage is a that second um.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=4674
1:18:00	Subverse is a little strange Um so heed your spirit that you do not.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=4680
1:18:08	Deal treacherously So I think I think that what's going on in this this particular.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=4688
1:18:16	Passage seems to be that God is hating divorce But not only that but those who.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=4696
1:18:23	Deal with in divorce.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=4703
1:18:29	Treacherously So that seems to be what's going on here So.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=4709
1:18:35	Um it is very poetic It's it's it's not an easy bit of.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=4715
1:18:41	Hebrew but um.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=4721
1:18:46	Um Andagram is that alluding to no div marriage after divorce not.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=4726
1:18:52	Necessarily U it does It seems to be alluding to sort of.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=4732
1:18:59	Treachery within marriage like people who try to try to find excuses for divorce you know pretense a pretense.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=4739
1:19:07	For divorce So it's in that way like for example you marry a woman she ages.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=4747
1:19:15	You want to trade her in for a younger m model but you.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=4755
1:19:22	Um don't have a good reason for divorce so you make one up I think it's more along those lines.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=4762
1:19:29	So those who deal treacherously as they try to seek.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=4769
1:19:36	Out a divorce which God hates to begin with So you're taking an act that God.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=4776
1:19:43	Disapproves of to begin with and then you add a guilty mind on top of it Yeah.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=4783
1:19:50	The Lord Lord's not going to like that So I think that's what what's being alluded to here Okay.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=4790
1:19:59	So I hope that helps A team thank you very much for the super chat Very much appreciate.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=4799

1:29:04	Okay Next one here from 18 ministers for 199 Thank you for the super chat Did.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=5344
1:29:11	Nefertiti take Nefra Nefu Aan as a throne name.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=5351
1:29:18	Um that's a controversial subject Now I think most people most of.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=5358
1:29:26	The it's I'd say the majority of Egyptologists now think that Nephroatin.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=5366
1:29:33	Was not Nefertiti but Nefertiti's daughter.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=5373
1:29:38	Okay But she had several she had I think something like four.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=5378
1:29:44	Daughters Okay She had four daughters Nefertiti had four daughters.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=5384
1:29:51	Okay And it does seem that one or two of them were placed on the.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=5391
1:29:59	Throne So the majority of Egyptologists seem to now lean towards the idea that.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=5399
1:30:05	Nephrodu at was one of these daughters of Nefertiti that she placed on the throne.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=5405
1:30:13	That she used her influence as with the royal court to put this per put.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=5413
1:30:22	Up one of her daughters on the throne at Amarna Okay that didn't last long.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=5422
1:30:29	Um we don't don't know the exact circumstances but that does not seem to have it seems to have lasted for less.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=5429
1:30:35	Than a year maybe a year tops that that these daughters of.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=5435
1:30:42	Nefertiti ruled Uh cuz it seems that Tudin Common was.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=5442
1:30:48	Backed by the military to to put an the the last Thean prince on the.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=5448
1:30:56	Throne cuz daughters taking the throne were.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=5456
1:31:01	Um had a much much weaker claim than.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=5461
1:31:07	A than a male heir So so it looks like and Nefertiti did.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=5467
1:31:16	Not have a claim to the throne She did not have a claim to the throne Um not in any meaningful.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=5476
1:31:22	Way but her daughters had a weak claim to the throne Her daughters had a bigger claim.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=5482
1:31:28	To the throne than she did So it sounds like that Nefertiti put her.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=5488
1:31:35	Daughters on the throne and and basically had basically a.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=5495
1:31:41	Puppet government So so she would be ruling through her.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=5501
1:31:50	Daughters which is generally what the majority think at this point as far as Nefroen is concerned Okay so I hope that.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=5510

1:33:12	And I think it's a it's a trajectory of of say atheism losing its steam.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=5592
1:33:22	Now when I was young yeah it it shocks people to when they find out I was once.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=5602
1:33:28	[Laughter] young Um atheism is just something that people held Okay you know it wasn't it.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=5608
1:33:36	Wasn't it wasn't a say a more ideological thing until you started getting guys like Sam Harris um.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=5616
1:33:47	Um Doc Richard Dawkins you know the new atheists okay the new atheists.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=5627
1:33:55	Um the new atheists made this very ideological.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=5635
1:34:01	Okay but now that sort of new atheist ism has lost its lost its gas Um it's.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=5641
1:34:09	It's lost its steam It's sort of sort of falling out of favor now.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=5649
1:34:16	Uh you're getting into a period where sort of atheism has gotten into.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=5656
1:34:24	Um what we would call say a partisan phase a doctrinire phase an ideological.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=5664
1:34:30	Phase where it's warrant doesn't matter once.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=5670
1:34:35	You start getting into partisanship and and ideology and.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=5675
1:34:41	Doctrinary kind of positions yeah all of that all of that just sort of you.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=5681
1:34:46	Don't need warrant anymore So.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=5686
1:34:53	Um so yeah that's that's just I think I think that's.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=5693
1:34:58	Just the sign of of of atheism sort of losing its losing its.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=5698
1:35:05	Momentum And this often happens you know with with various positions various.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=5705
1:35:11	Positions that have difficulty defending themselves and then resorting to.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=5711
1:35:18	Um just nuh-uh.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=5718
1:35:23	Arguments you know it's not it's not a reasonable debate anymore So you just this is just what happens.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=5723
1:35:32	When you when when sort of movements like this run their course.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=5732

1:40:39	Um was Miriam's complaining and being in the tent a double offense now that was a.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=6039
1:40:44	Double offense Okay Um in in the case of Miriam she had not only questioned um.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=6044
1:40:52	God's word she had also entered into the tent of meeting okay which yeah there there.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=6052
1:40:59	Was a double offense there so in the case of Miriam there was a double offense in Moses what caused him to not.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=6059
1:41:08	Enter Canaan was the fact that he had misrepresented what God said by acting.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=6068
1:41:15	Angry towards the Israelites when he struck the stone for water.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=6075
1:41:21	Okay so in that particular case it was a single offense But what Moses had done was.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=6081
1:41:28	Shown the Israelites that God was angry when God wasn't.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=6088
1:41:34	Angry So that was Moses's anger being taken out on the Israelites.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=6094
1:41:43	And it's it's basically a violation of the.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=6103
1:41:48	Um of the um.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=6108
1:41:53	Oh of the commandment which one was it.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=6113
1:41:58	Now taking the Lord thy God's name in.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=6118

1:42:10	The that that commandment is actually about is being a poor.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=6130
1:42:18	Representative of of somebody who takes on the name of God Okay.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=6138
1:42:28	So yeah like all of Gab and Grabbits you know people who claim to be ministers of God and basically aren't representing.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=6148
1:42:34	Him at all Okay So so that's what Moses was guilty on was misrepresenting God to.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=6154
1:42:43	The Israelites So that was a serious enough offense that it didn't take a double.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=6163
1:42:49	Offense That was just serious enough on its own.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=6169
1:42:56	Uh but in the case of Miriam there was a double offense there You know she was.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=6176
1:43:01	She had questioned God's word and she had also was not supposed to be in.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=6181

1:43:42	The same time Yeah Um it is one offense but it does sort of.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=6222
1:43:48	Violate two things So I'm not sure if it's if that would be still constitute as a double offense or.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=6228
1:43:57	One offense that just did two things but he did But you're absolutely.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=6237

1:45:07	In Egypt for 400 years Okay.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=6307
1:45:16	So that's what makes him a prophet is he was given prophecies.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=6316
1:45:22	Okay So I hope that helps Thank you very much for the super chat very much.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=6322

1:45:49	And you cannot get around that with that Okay.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=6349
1:45:56	So if you're in one of those denominations that insists that communions has to have wine.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=6356
1:46:03	Um then you're kind of stuck with wine But there's also depends upon the.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=6363
1:46:12	Denomination Um some denominations like.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=6372
1:46:19	Um some denominations will also allow you to use water.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=6379
1:46:25	Okay Uh yeah most most denominations will make exceptions for.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=6385

1:47:24	Essentially Um so a lot of it is is going to depend upon the denomination Um but it again um.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=6444

1:47:55	Boy In 2 minutes or less Yeah good luck with that.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=6475
1:48:01	Um all right Let's let's talk a little bit about Daniel 11 okay because this.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=6481
1:48:06	One this one is this is an ugly passage All right Um this is an ugly passage.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=6486
1:48:14	Because it's prophecy It's not clear prophecy Um I know there are people who.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=6494
1:48:20	Have suggested this is the tools and the solucides going after at each other.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=6500
1:48:28	But there also seems to be some intimation of that this also involves the abomination that makes desolate Okay.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=6508
1:48:37	Before he gets into or after he gets into that Now the particular passage here is.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=6517
1:48:43	30 or sorry verses 37 Okay Now it's talking about here a.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=6523
1:48:52	Back and forth between the king of the north and the king of the south Again we don't know exactly who the king of the.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=6532
1:48:58	North and who the king of the south is Some people have have suggested that the king of the north is the solucids King.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=6538
1:49:04	Of the south is the tools Okay but we're not sure.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=6544
1:49:12	Okay but then we get this this passage in verse.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=6552
1:49:17	37 and it talks about a king of the north and who that.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=6557
1:49:25	Is It starts here in verse 36 Then the king will do as he pleases and he will.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=6565
1:49:33	Exalt and magnify himself above every god and will speak monstrous things.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=6573
1:49:40	Against the God of gods And he will prosper until the indignation is.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=6580
1:49:47	Finished For that which is decreed will be done Verse 37 And he will show no.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=6587
1:49:53	Regard to the gods of his fathers or for the desire of women Nor will he show.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=6593
1:49:59	Regard for any other god For he will magnify himself above them all But.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=6599
1:50:06	Instead he will honor a god of fortresses a god whom his fathers did not know He will honor him with gold.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=6606
1:50:14	Silver costly stones and treasures and he will take action against the strongest of forces with the help of a.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=6614
1:50:20	Foreign god He will give great honor to those who acknowledge him and he will cause them to rule over many and will.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=6620
1:50:27	Parcel out the land for a price Verse 40 And at the end of.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=6627
1:50:34	Time at the end time the king of the south will collide with him And the king.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=6634
1:50:39	Of the north will storm against him with chariots and with horsemen and with many ships And he will enter countries.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=6639
1:50:45	Overthrow them and pass through He will also enter the beautiful.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=6645
1:50:52	Land and many countries will fall but these will be rescued out of his hand.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=6652
1:50:57	Edom Moab and the foremost of the sons of Ammon He will stretch out his hand against other countries and the land of.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=6657
1:51:04	Egypt will not escape All right So what we're talking.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=6664
1:51:10	Here is looks like yeah it does it on the surface it.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=6670
1:51:17	Appears like Antiochus the fourth epiphanies but it's it's more than that It's.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=6677
1:51:23	More than that Um Antiochus It could be that this is this is representing Antiochus but.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=6683
1:51:31	Antiochus was just a type of antichrist Uh he was the.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=6691
1:51:36	Archetype Okay But he's not the anti-ype.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=6696
1:51:42	So there does seem to be that it's it's a a loose.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=6702
1:51:50	Um a loose illusion to Antiochus IV but it does seem to be that there's that.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=6710
1:51:58	That this is esqueological as well as in verse 40 it says at the end.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=6718
1:52:05	Time Okay if this was during the time of of.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=6725
1:52:12	Antiochus this is not the end time Antiochus is the beginning of that.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=6732
1:52:19	Topology So it's the beginning of the Antichrist.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=6739
1:52:28	Trajectory So you wouldn't expect that that that phrasing at the end time to be.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=6748
1:52:37	To be applicable to Antiochus because Antiochus IV is an.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=6757
1:52:44	Antichrist He's the archetype of the antichrist but he's not the the the.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=6764
1:52:49	Fulfillment of that trajectory So getting back to that.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=6769
1:52:55	Particular verse 11:37.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=6775
1:53:01	So whoever this figure is he will show no regard to the gods of.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=6781
1:53:06	His father Okay so he's not a religious man Okay he's not a religious.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=6786
1:53:12	Man He basically is thumbming his nose at the gods of his.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=6792
1:53:19	Fathers or for the desire of women Okay so he's he he doesn't care.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=6799
1:53:27	About bodily pleasure at least not from women It's.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=6807
1:53:32	Not what it's it's not what motivates him He's not motivated by religion of.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=6812
1:53:39	His of his ancestors He's not motivated by by say sexual.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=6819
1:53:48	Pleasure at least not from women Um and he will not show regard for.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=6828
1:53:55	Any other god And and what this is doing is it's.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=6835
1:54:01	Giving you the mindset of this antitype of the.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=6841
1:54:06	Antichrist okay of of the abomination that makes desolate So he's basically saying that.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=6846
1:54:13	This is this is a guy of of of focus He is incredibly focused.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=6853
1:54:20	He's not focused on he's he's not distracted by religion He's not distracted by by women He doesn't he.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=6860
1:54:26	"Doesn't regard any other deity Uh and it says at the end of verse 37 ""For he will."	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=6866
1:54:33	"Magnify himself above all of them."" Mama says ""Sounds like a."	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=6873

1:55:36	Armies Verse 39 and he will take action against the strongest of fortresses with.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=6936

2:08:06	The passage Read the passage and let's execute the passage.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=7686
2:08:12	Hebrews chapter 7 verse 15 17.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=7692
2:08:22	"All right And the author of Hebrews in verse 15 says ""And this is clear still."	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=7702
2:08:28	If another priest arises according to the likeness of Melkisedc who has become such not on the.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=7708
2:08:36	Basis of a law of physical requirement but according to the power of an.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=7716
2:08:42	Indestructible life For it is witnessed of him thou art a priest.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=7722
2:08:49	Forever according to the order of MelkiseDC All.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=7729
2:08:55	Right Now the context of Hebrews.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=7735
2:09:01	7 is that Hebrews has two themes There's two.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=7741
2:09:08	Themes in the book of Hebrews Okay one theme is that.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=7748
2:09:15	Um to warn you against apostasy The second theme is that Christ.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=7755
2:09:21	Is greater than anything He's greater than the law He's greater than the.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=7761
2:09:27	Prophets He's greater he's greater than the unfulfilled promises and he's greater than the.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=7767
2:09:35	Priests Why is he greater than the priest and this is what Hebrews 7 sort.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=7775
2:09:41	Of lays out Okay why Christ is better than the.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=7781
2:09:47	Priesthood Okay and it comes down to that he is a priest in the order as.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=7787
2:09:53	Accord according to the order of Melkazedc Now what does that mean now.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=7793
2:10:01	Specifically MelkiseDC is was the ruler of of Salem.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=7801
2:10:08	Uh Uru Salem which was a Jebusite city It was a.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=7808
2:10:13	City of Jebusites Um it was the old Jerusalem before it became Jerusalem Okay It was.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=7813
2:10:22	Um as I said it was a Jebusite city It was a pagan city It worshiped the god.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=7822
2:10:30	Shalam which was a a ideological god a god of peace Okay.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=7830
2:10:39	Um Zadok melkisedc comes from the name u.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=7839
2:10:46	Melki zedok Zado is king and zadok was another Jebisite god Zadok is the.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=7846
2:10:54	God of righteousness So these are the sort of categories that um Jebiside gods took on So a a.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=7854
2:11:03	Jebiside god would be say a god of peace a god of of of righteousness They'd also.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=7863
2:11:08	Have probably gods of war as well and that sort of categories.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=7868
2:11:13	So So that's how the Jebusites did their their religion It was it was an ideological.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=7873
2:11:20	Um kind of of god okay set of gods Okay.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=7880
2:11:26	Now MelkiseDC in the in in the text is honored as a priest by.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=7886
2:11:32	Abraham MelkiseDC is a king and a priest which.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=7892
2:11:38	Is something that's not a Levitical priest He is not a priest according to.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=7898
2:11:43	The law He is a de facto priest a king priest during the patriarchal period.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=7903
2:11:52	Okay So so then when here it in verse 15 it.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=7912
2:12:00	Talks about it is clear still if another priest arises.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=7920
2:12:05	Okay Because what it's talking about the context for that another priest here.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=7925
2:12:11	Is verse 14 For it is evident that our Lord was descended from.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=7931
2:12:17	Judah Okay Judahites can't be priests Okay they can't be priests Priests have.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=7937
2:12:24	To come from the tribe of Levi and specifically from the family of Aaron.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=7944
2:12:31	Okay so verse 14 it is evident that our Lord was descended from Judah a tribe.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=7951
2:12:38	With reference to which Moses spoke nothing concerning priests All right So there's no.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=7958
2:12:48	Basically means through the law for which a Judahite can become a.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=7968
2:12:54	Priest Okay Now verse 15 This is clear.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=7974
2:13:00	Still If another priest arises according to the likeness of.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=7980
2:13:07	Melkazedc what's the likeness of Melzdc the priest king a king who is.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=7987
2:13:14	Also a priest Now that is forbidden by Mosaic law but it has precedent.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=7994
2:13:22	Still Okay So because it has.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=8002
2:13:27	Precedent it can happen but it can't happen through the normal opaces of the.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=8007
2:13:35	Levitical law It's got to happen through some other means.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=8015
2:13:41	"And verse 16 lays out what those means are 16 says ""Who has become such not on."	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=8021
2:13:50	The basis of a law a physical requirement that's descendant of Levite.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=8030
2:13:57	But according to the power of an indestructible.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=8037
2:14:02	"Life."" That indestructible life is the reference to the."	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=8042
2:14:08	Resurrection Verse 17 for it is witnessed of him thou.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=8048
2:14:14	Art a priest forever according to the order of Melkazedc It basically the order of.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=8054
2:14:21	MelkiseDC is a oneoff priesthood essentially from Melkazedc.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=8061
2:14:27	First and then through Jesus Christ through that power of not only being the.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=8067
2:14:33	The king of kings by physical requirement but then he is resurrected.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=8073
2:14:40	From the dead becoming the the the priest according to MelkiseDC forever Okay So.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=8080
2:14:49	The fact that he cannot be destroyed he is now an everlasting everliving.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=8089
2:14:56	King He is now entered into that priesthood of of Melkisedc through that.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=8096
2:15:04	Power of being.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=8104
2:15:09	Resurrected So that's what it means to be a priest.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=8109
2:15:14	Of the order of MelkiseDC So one you're not of the tribe of Levi.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=8114
2:15:20	Two you're a king Three you're resurrected from the.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=8120
2:15:28	Dead Okay So that's what this this passage of.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=8128
2:15:33	Hebrews 7:15 to 7:3 means in a nutshell it it it lays out three requirements uh.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=8133
2:15:40	For for that whole Melkchisedc priesthood.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=8140

2:19:00	One bit Um and it's on the coastal plane there So I mean the Egyptians were.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=8340
2:19:06	Very very sensitive about anything that sort of went down on the coastal plane anyway Um Japas being on the on the.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=8346
2:19:14	Coastal plane Yeah absolutely It would have ticked off the Egyptians if if.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=8354

2:20:45	19 In dynasty 19 the magi were not warriors anymore.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=8445
2:20:51	Uh they were at that point the magi were community leaders um.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=8451
2:20:57	Constables guards police.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=8457
2:21:04	Officers Yeah Before that that they were guarding both sides of the fence.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=8464
2:21:12	Yeah Uh the whole story of the magi is very interesting Basically they sort of.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=8472
2:21:18	Ran this this scam where during.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=8478
2:21:24	The second intermediate period the magi worked for both sides They worked for.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=8484
2:21:30	The Egyptians and they worked for the Nubians and they were.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=8490
2:21:37	Basically mercenaries doing basically border patrols And when they came across each.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=8497
2:21:44	Other's forces they just have lunch Okay They didn't fight each other They they just had.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=8504

2:22:06	Them guards community representatives police.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=8526
2:22:12	Officers constables more them than police officers but.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=8532
2:22:18	Uh basically they're peace officers as such but they weren't elite warriors.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=8538
2:22:24	And even when they were mercenaries they were never elite warriors as such.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=8544
2:22:30	Okay So this basically the idea that was.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=8550

2:24:35	But again great film Love that film Okay Andrew Cooler for $20 Thank.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=8675
2:24:42	You for the super chat What is it about the Song of Deborah that many scholars are convinced.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=8682
2:24:48	That it is the oldest part of the Bible and it dates back to the 1200s BC um.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=8688
2:24:55	Okay Um it doesn't date to the 1200s Um it that's probably a century.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=8695
2:25:04	Too late Um it the the the fact is it probably.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=8704
2:25:12	More dates to the 1100s Okay But that's okay That's that's just a hundred years But.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=8712
2:25:19	Um what it is what makes people think the song of Deborah is old is that it's.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=8719
2:25:26	Poetry Now here's what people a lot of.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=8726
2:25:32	Scholars think Poetry is a precursor to.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=8732
2:25:37	Pros Therefore if you have a poetic section it's uses archaic language.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=8737
2:25:44	Therefore it must be older than the pros I think this is so wrong I think.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=8744
2:25:52	This is so messed up.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=8752
2:26:00	Poetry in almost every language uses.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=8760
2:26:07	Archaisms That's something we find in poetry.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=8767
2:26:13	Everywhere Uh the second thing is that poetry doesn't predate.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=8773
2:26:20	Pros Um this is a literary theory that was debunked ages ago.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=8780
2:26:26	I mean it's been debunked for over a century but yet for some reason this.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=8786
2:26:32	Still persists among biblical scholarship that because it's a poem.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=8792
2:26:38	It's got to be.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=8798
2:26:45	Older Yeah it's not true but it should be right yeah that sort of thing.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=8805
2:26:51	"Mama says ""Poetry is easy to recall orally but arguing it came before pros."	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=8811
2:26:56	"Is ridiculous."" Yeah Well especially since we do have."	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=8816
2:27:01	Contemporary sources in the ancient near east particularly Egypt that combine poetry.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=8821
2:27:09	And pros in the same document you know like we have for.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=8829
2:27:15	Example the annals of Tutmosis III you know and the battle of Kadesh.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=8835
2:27:21	You know these are sections like in the battle of Kadesh there is a pro section and a poetry section.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=8841
2:27:28	In the mptistila there's a pro section and a poetry section Same document.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=8848
2:27:34	Written same time there They date to exactly the same.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=8854
2:27:40	Time One is not older because it has poetry in it And the poetry has.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=8860
2:27:49	Archaisms Huh Funny that But it's written at the same time.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=8869
2:27:55	As the pros It's it's an outofdate obsolete literary theory that.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=8875
2:28:02	Just refuses to die in biblical.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=8882
2:28:13	Studies BC modern day modern day poems must have been written in 1200 BC because poetry is old.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=8893
2:28:20	Yeah that's it's it's it's that kind of reasoning bully thinking.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=8900
2:28:26	Mama it's like arguing that multiplication came before division What yeah pretty.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=8906
2:28:32	Much Yeah it's Yeah it's that that sort of rationale It's it's as I said it's.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=8912
2:28:39	It's obsolete literary theory that just.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=8919
2:28:45	Thumbs its nose at the facts It thumbs it nose at the evidence.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=8925
2:28:53	So but that's that's the reason why they claim this is because the song of.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=8933
2:28:59	Deborah has Hebrew archaisms in it and it's poetry because these documents were.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=8939
2:29:06	Passed orally It must predate the pros There's just no evidence for that this.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=8946
2:29:13	Sort of development took place in ancient sources.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=8953
2:29:20	And tons of contrary evidence to the effect Again we got lots and lots of.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=8960
2:29:27	Documents from Egypt that have both poetry and pros in the same document that were written at the same time.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=8967
2:29:35	Poetry has archaisms the pros doesn't But you know what they're provable that they were.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=8975
2:29:42	Written at the same time because they're dated at the same time So yeah it just this is something.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=8982
2:29:50	That just drives me nuts again about biblical scholarship It's pig ignorant about say the primary.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=8990
2:29:57	Sources but it just doubles down on obsolete literary theories.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=8997
2:30:09	Okay next super chat here is from Johnny Mo for $20 Thank you for the super chat What do you think of the idea of a.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=9009
2:30:16	Gradual unveiling of the character of God to help explain things like harsh judgments in the Old Testament mercy on.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=9016
2:30:23	The Assyrians and Jonah and culminating in the person of Jesus see Matthew 13:17.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=9023
2:30:28	Let's take a look at Matthew 13:17 here then I'll comment.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=9028
2:30:38	Matthew 13.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=9038
2:30:43	17 for truly I say to you many pro there that many prophets and righteous men desire to see what you see and did not.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=9043
2:30:50	See it and hear what you hear and did not hear it Okay.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=9050
2:30:57	Uh yes this is called theologians call this.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=9057
2:31:03	Progressive revelation that's what this is in I mean this is this is almost.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=9063
2:31:09	Accepted as fact amongst theologians okay that this is that that.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=9069
2:31:15	Revelation is progressive okay so.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=9075
2:31:20	Um so this is what we're talking about here where God doesn't dump everything on people at once but he slowly teases.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=9080
2:31:29	It out over time through supplemental revelations through additive revelation.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=9089
2:31:35	Through that sort of thing And the whole process is called progressive revelation.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=9095
2:31:41	So this is this is again now some of those.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=9101
2:31:48	Some of the things you've said here are a little bit of a oversimplification like the gradual.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=9108
2:31:56	Unveiling of the character of God to explain things like harsh judgments in the Old Testament Not.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=9116
2:32:02	Necessarily I would say that not necessarily harsh but culturally.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=9122
2:32:08	Appropriate Okay Um and that's there there is a nuance there that I think we need to balance Some of the judgments.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=9128
2:32:15	Were not so harsh as they were culturally appropriate but God's working.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=9135
2:32:21	Within human culture to bring to unveil who he is through it So I think.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=9141
2:32:30	We got to be a little cautious there The mercy on the Assyrians in Jonah Again that's that's sort of.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=9150
2:32:37	Something that's been a constant theme in in the Old Testament which is.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=9157
2:32:44	Um that Israelite religion was supposed to reach out to the.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=9164
2:32:50	Non-Israelite and it culminating in the person of Jesus Christ Again he's the consummation of all of.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=9170
2:32:56	That So again this is all consistent with the idea of progressive.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=9176
2:33:02	Revelation And there are many theologians that do talk about progressive revelation So yeah it's.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=9182
2:33:10	It's a it's a well-known concept inside of a theology So I hope that helped.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=9190
2:33:15	Thank you very much for the super chat Very much appreciate it Uh Mike JSB for $2 Thank you for the.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=9195

2:35:11	Those journals that has a a pretty harsh embargo So.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=9311

2:36:31	Relocates at another time period Uh that happened at Migdal It happened at um.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=9391
2:36:37	Pitham Um it probably happened at Hotsour It happens from time to time.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=9397
2:36:44	It's even happened at Jericho you know the you got say early to late to.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=9404
2:36:52	Um bisantine Jericho and then the site.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=9412
2:36:57	Picks up and moves to another location in the Roman period So you got a Roman age Jericho and then you have the the.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=9417
2:37:05	Iron and bronze age Jericho and they're different sites So that can happen So.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=9425
2:37:11	So that's one possible things Another thing that could have happened at Tel Hasheshban was sight leveling Okay Same.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=9431
2:37:17	Thing that happened to to late Bron's 2B Jericho could have happened to Teshban.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=9437
2:37:22	As well So that's a possibility as well that after Heshbon was destroyed a.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=9442
2:37:28	Later Israelites came leveled the site and then rebuilded on it during the iron.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=9448
2:37:33	Age See so that that's a possibility as well So we can't exclude that possibility now from any site that where.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=9453
2:37:41	We don't find something So because of that whole site.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=9461
2:37:47	Leveling thing now yeah all bets are off as to absence of evidence arguments.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=9467
2:37:54	I mean it should have been anyway Absence of evidence arguments are  arguments I mean they're.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=9474
2:38:03	Terrible Yeah We finally found positive evidence of why there's.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=9483
2:38:09	Absence So that's going to be an issue for for any of sites going forward that.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=9489
2:38:14	Claim oh well it didn't happen here because we don't find evidence Okay now we got a we got a.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=9494
2:38:22	Potential reason why something might not be.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=9502
2:38:28	There So yeah it it's also the case of Gibian.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=9508
2:38:34	As well So so it's it really is going to we're going to have to reassess a lot.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=9514
2:38:40	Of these sites Now one of the things for example like at.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=9520
2:38:45	Heshbhon tell Heshbond one of the things they they there is some late bronze 2B.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=9525
2:38:51	Pottery at Heshbond Um it's in the site report Okay.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=9531
2:38:58	The Teshban does have there is late bronze 2B pottery found at.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=9538
2:39:06	Teshban What's not found there is the remains of a city.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=9546
2:39:12	Now here's the here's the here's the funky thing about hell heshbond is.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=9552
2:39:20	Um that everyone recognizes that there is blade bronze tube pottery at Teshban.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=9560
2:39:26	But they just say well you know this is just some random people walking using the site you know as a campsite You know.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=9566
2:39:32	They're their temporary residence Well how do they know that there's no context for that pottery other than it's late.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=9572
2:39:39	Bronze 2b Okay So everyone recognizes that there's.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=9579
2:39:47	Pots 2B pottery at Tellesbond just not a city That sounds eerily like what we.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=9587
2:39:54	What we had at Jericho Okay Eerily like what we had at Jericho you know we had at Jericho we.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=9594
2:40:02	Had you know a middle bronze city and.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=9602
2:40:08	Then it just sort of the strategist skips from from middle bronze two or.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=9608
2:40:16	Three depending on your periodation to Iron.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=9616
2:40:21	Age Well we now know that there was occupation from you know the end of.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=9621
2:40:29	Basically late bronze 1 all the way through to late bronze.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=9629
2:40:35	2b We have late bronze 2 pottery at Jericho We got fragments of a.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=9635
2:40:42	Destruction layer Not a big one but fragments in some of the.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=9642
2:40:47	Houses So so yeah this is this is again all.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=9647
2:40:53	Bets are off on absence of evidence arguments now And I really think that.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=9653
2:40:59	People who still double down on these absence of evidence arguments are bad historians They're bad historians.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=9659
2:41:07	Okay So I don't think Teshbon is a problem anymore Um it shouldn't have.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=9667
2:41:13	Been a problem to begin with but now we have justification as to why it's not a.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=9673
2:41:18	Problem anymore Which.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=9678
2:41:24	One geological shift not man Yeah that's a positive potential thing too Um.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=9684
2:41:30	That's happened before earthquakes or like for example earthquakes.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=9690
2:41:38	And can change how things you know you know progress.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=9698
2:41:45	Um like early Bronze Age Jericho was destroyed by an.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=9705
2:41:51	Earthquake an earthquake caused the abandonment of Betha or Bethesda depending on how you.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=9711
2:41:58	Want to pronounce it but Betha was abandoned because of an earthquake that.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=9718
2:42:04	Caused the site to elevate which caused the Sea of Galilee to recede 40 miles.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=9724
2:42:12	From this fishing village So people just abandon the.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=9732
2:42:18	Abandon the fishing village because there's no more sea there.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=9738
2:42:23	Yeah bad fishing after that So geology can play a role in these.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=9743
2:42:29	Things too But there's a lots of reasons why these things can happen Water supply dries up You.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=9749
2:42:36	Know dang that's a heck of an uplift Yeah it is Um you know this is like but it.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=9756
2:42:44	Also led to the preservation of this too Uh in fact I think in the Israeli.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=9764
2:42:50	Antiquities um authority now has made Betha an archaeological park This is now.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=9770
2:42:57	The park of the disciples because this is the home of Peter Okay This is the.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=9777
2:43:02	Hometown of Peter And ironically it was.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=9782
2:43:07	Preserved This this fishing village was preserved because of the earthquake.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=9787
2:43:14	Earthquake pushed it up like 40 feet The water just rushed away from it and.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=9794
2:43:20	"People said ""Uh where did the sea."	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=9800
2:43:28	"Go?"" And they picked up and moved closer to the ocean or the Sea of Galloway where they could resume."	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=9808
2:43:37	Fishing But yeah geology plays can play a role in this too Lots of reasons for this.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=9817
2:43:44	Okay so anyway I hope that helps Thank you for the super chat Very much.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=9824
2:43:49	Appreciate it Okay Esther for $2 Hey Esther How's.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=9829
2:43:56	It going it's good to see you here tonight Why would Elizabeth keep secluded luke 124 Oh interesting.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=9836
2:44:04	Question Okay Luke 1 verse.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=9844
2:44:13	24 All right This is a very interesting Now this is this is talking about the um.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=9853
2:44:20	Um the pregnancy of Elizabeth who is going to give birth to John.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=9860
2:44:27	The Baptist Okay Now verse 24 it reads after these days Elizabeth his wife.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=9867
2:44:35	Became pregnant and she kept herself in seclusion for 5 months saying this is.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=9875
2:44:41	The way the Lord has dealt with me in the days when he looked with favor upon me to take away my disgrace among men.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=9881
2:44:49	Okay Now the question is.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=9889
2:44:57	Um what is happening here that would cause Elizabeth to go into seclusion for.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=9897
2:45:02	5 months now there's nothing in the Levitical law that says a pregnant woman has to go into seclusion Nothing So this.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=9902
2:45:10	Is not something that's caused by anything that's written in the.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=9910
2:45:18	Bible But what we get here is a hint from verse 25.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=9918
2:45:25	Um where she says this is the way the Lord has dealt with me in these in the days when he looked with favor upon me.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=9925
2:45:33	To take away and this is the key portion here Take away my disgrace among.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=9933
2:45:39	Men Here's what's happening Elizabeth is barren.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=9939
2:45:45	Okay Now here's what I think and scholars are going to disagree on this because again.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=9945
2:45:52	This is not a clear passage okay because it's not again we don't have a precedent.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=9952
2:45:58	In the Old Testament to say why should you be in seclusion But here's my thought on this Um.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=9958
2:46:08	Um what is Elizabeth is barren Okay And that's a.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=9968
2:46:16	That's a mark of shame right now Okay.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=9976
2:46:21	But the other mark of shame that could happen.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=9981
2:46:27	To is.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=9987
2:46:32	Um what we would call today.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=9992
2:46:37	Um peacos Okay polycystic ovarian syndrome.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=9997
2:46:44	Okay Where a woman can start packing on a little weight at the waist but her.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10004
2:46:51	Their thighs sort of lose muscle tone.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10011
2:46:59	Okay This was associated not just with barrenness.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10019
2:47:04	Um and polycystic ovarian syndrome can cause infertility causes.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10024
2:47:11	Infertility but it was also seen in Israelite culture as.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10031
2:47:17	Being how do I say this the result of infidelity.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10037
2:47:26	Okay So we talked a bit a while ago about the a h a husband accuses a wife.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10046
2:47:34	Of infidelity and she goes and they perform.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10054
2:47:39	A ceremony in front of the priest where they she drinks a water with.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10059
2:47:46	Some ash in it And what can happen if if God.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10066
2:47:52	Decides that she was um.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10072
2:47:59	Cheating she would she would develop this condition where the the the abdomen.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10079
2:48:05	Becomes distended and the legs lose muscle tone And essentially it's the.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10085
2:48:11	It's a symptom of infertility Okay it's a symptom of infertility The idea of this is that if.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10091
2:48:18	She had she takes a vow before God that she didn't cheat and if she cheated she would be struck infertile.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10098
2:48:25	Okay Now one of the problems with polycystic.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10105
2:48:32	Uh ovarian syndrome is it can look like early stage.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10112
2:48:41	Pregnancy Okay It can look like early stage pregnancy.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10121
2:48:49	And it was it could be.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10129
2:48:55	Seen that Elizabeth had sort of the the.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10135
2:49:01	Look of somebody with this kind of infertility She had been she had been.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10141
2:49:07	Pregnant or she had been barren most of her marriage She was a barren woman She.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10147
2:49:12	Had no but now she starts looking like she's a little.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10152
2:49:18	Pregnant Yeah Okay People are going to start talking They're going to start.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10158
2:49:23	Talking out of ignorance that she was was.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10163
2:49:29	Cheating She was cheating and she was starting to look like a woman who had been struck.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10169
2:49:35	Infertile Okay Because of of of infidelity So what she does is she hides.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10175
2:49:42	For five months so nobody sees her in her early.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10182
2:49:48	Stages of pregnancy She emerges after five months when it's clear she's pregnant.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10188
2:49:55	Okay where she's big enough that it's no longer in doubt that.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10195
2:50:01	She's pregnant So she avoids the accusation of.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10201
2:50:07	Infidelity by staying in seclusion until it's clear that she is pregnant not suffering from.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10207
2:50:16	This kind of infertility.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10216
2:50:22	Okay Oh yeah Totally sucked.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10222
2:50:28	"Yeah Mama says ""I figured that figured because her husband wasn't allowed to talk she went in seclusion to avoid the."	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10228
2:50:35	"Awkward conversations in general."" Well okay He wasn't allowed to talk but that."	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10235
2:50:42	Also means he can't say anything to defend her either.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10242
2:50:49	Yeah mama Yesesh Both her and Mary had so much to deal with Oh yeah.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10249
2:51:01	Absolutely Oh yeah It's Yeah You don't want to be chosen by God It's for that thing Yeah.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10261
2:51:15	BC but Dr Faulk the the the the gospels made it up Why include such random.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10275
2:51:23	Details because details are important It's the little things that.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10283
2:51:29	[Laughter] matter man.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10289
2:51:36	If you can get the little things right it lends credibility to the stuff And.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10296
2:51:42	That's what I think is going on here is we've got these little details here that.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10302
2:51:47	Would have you know explained why she's going into seclusion at that particular time.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10307
2:51:55	And again it's a this is about shame and disgrace That's why she's in hiding to.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10315
2:52:00	Avoid shame and disgrace you know she's already barren but now she starts showing the.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10320
2:52:07	Signs of infertility when she's actually fertile That would bring extra shame and.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10327
2:52:14	Disgrace Yeah And then she can't celebrate this This is not then something.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10334
2:52:19	That Yeah It's just you know she's kind of in a lose-lose.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10339
2:52:24	Situation You know she if she's barren she's shamed If she's.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10344
2:52:32	Infertile which shows the signs of infertility on top of that she's double.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10352
2:52:38	Shamed So she can't win Um so she has to stay in seclusion until it's obvious.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10358
2:52:46	That she she's with child Yeah This is the mother of John.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10366
2:52:52	The Baptist Yeah.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10372
2:52:57	You know so it's it's kind of she doesn't really if she wants to maintain the respectability and and and her.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10377
2:53:04	Father and and her husband's a priest Her husband's a priest So it's not just shame on her.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10384
2:53:10	It's shame on him too.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10390
2:53:16	So so it's I they just decided it was the best for everybody She's just be in.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10396
2:53:22	Seclusion for 5 months until it's obvious what's going.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10402
2:53:27	On Okay So I hope that helps Esther thank you very much for that question It's an interesting question and uh.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10407
2:53:34	That's again scholars differ on this but that's what I think is going on here.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10414
2:53:43	Okay next one here is from Esther for $5 Thank you for the super chat When people more educated than I.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10423
2:53:49	Disagree how can the lame person discern truth and speak confident oo.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10429
2:53:57	Uh that's a tough question Um that's a tough.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10437
2:54:05	Question Uh this is why I always suggest you go back to the word of God Okay.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10445
2:54:11	Go back to the word of God really examine it and you know compare compare the.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10451
2:54:19	Options You know there's nothing nothing preventing you from if if you.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10459
2:54:26	Um if you disagree with an expert The expert's not automatically right I mean I proved tonight I'm not automatically.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10466
2:54:32	Right Okay Okay Experts can get things.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10472
2:54:38	Wrong you know and you know they're human We're everyone's human We all make.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10478
2:54:45	Mistakes Okay Do you double down on the mistakes well that's where you have to use.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10485
2:54:52	Discernment to figure this out I'm not saying it's easy okay it could be.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10492
2:55:00	Very very difficult to discern between two different experts on.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10500
2:55:06	Something But then again that's that's what's incumbent upon us.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10506
2:55:12	So what I would do in in in the case.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10512
2:55:17	Where say an expert and I would disagree is I'd go to the commentaries I'd look things up research it Research it see.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10517
2:55:27	What a variety of opinions says on it You know don't just trust one source.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10527
2:55:32	Consult many sources Yeah Yeah What's their context what's.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10532
2:55:38	Their biases what's what did they publish before you know do they have a.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10538
2:55:49	Yeah My my producer asks you know is this a denominational difference is this.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10549
2:55:55	An academic difference is this a presuppositional difference you know is.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10555
2:56:01	This the I mean is this a Is this something they were talking Sunday school they didn't do you know is this.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10561
2:56:08	Something they're just repeating from Sunday school yep I mean experts do that.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10568
2:56:14	You know experts do that I mean they they I mean nobody escapes their Sunday.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10574
2:56:19	School training Even experts.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10579
2:56:27	Uh Andrew Graeme are we assuming they're an expert well are they an expert i mean you get people who are.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10587
2:56:34	More more educated on certain subjects that aren't actually.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10594
2:56:40	Experts you know So again you know you just you just have.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10600
2:56:49	To mama No one escapes Sunday school unscathed Exactly Um yeah Um Sunday school.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10609
2:56:58	Theology has done a lot of damage It's done a lot of damage It's done a lot of good but it's also done a lot of harm.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10618
2:57:08	"Too Uh Keeps Learning says ""It must be hard for experts to admit they're wrong all along when they've built their."	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10628
2:57:15	"Careers on a wrong interpretation like the early Exodus."" Yeah it is Um look."	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10635
2:57:20	Here's the thing Um most experts aren't.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10640
2:57:27	Evidentialists Oh they like to say they follow the evidence but they really don't Most.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10647
2:57:34	Experts will essentially just double down on whatever.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10654
2:57:41	They were they were taught whatever they sort of picked up And the very few.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10661
2:57:47	Experts change their mind you know along the way Uh a few that have integrity do and.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10667
2:57:55	It really frustrates all the other experts Um you know there seems to be this this ongoing expectation in the um.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10675
2:58:03	Academic world that once you have your PhD you you stop stop growing and.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10683
2:58:10	Learning and following the evidence Well yeah that might be convenient in.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10690
2:58:17	The academic world but it's not very smart You know it's not very.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10697
2:58:27	Smart you know So you know people tend to become oified in their in their.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10707
2:58:32	Knowledge and their opinion You know they get to to a point in their education where they learn all they want.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10712
2:58:38	To learn and that's it that they stop learning and then they just repeat what they.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10718
2:58:45	Learned Which is why you have these people who are still sort of spouting.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10725
2:58:50	Obsolete views you know and and and they just don't ever.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10730
2:58:55	Think about it because thinking is hard It hurts Okay So.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10735
2:59:03	Um and I mean there was who was I forget who said this.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10743
2:59:10	Theories don't convince academics They what happens is academics.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10750
2:59:18	Simply die off Okay So the idea here is.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10758
2:59:26	That you know evidence doesn't convince academics.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10766
2:59:31	What happens is the old academics die and a new generation comes along that.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10771
2:59:38	Has fresh thinking Okay.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10778
2:59:45	So so that's how that's how things change in the academic world is it.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10785
2:59:54	Doesn't it's not a matter of of who has the best evidence It's that whoever has.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10794
2:59:59	The best evidence convinces the young academics to accept it and then the old ones just simply die.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10799
3:00:09	Off So I'm getting back to the original.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10809
3:00:14	Question here How do you how do you discern the.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10814
3:00:22	Truth and then speak confidently of it is you've got.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10822
3:00:27	To you've got to figure it out for yourself You got to figure it out And.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10827
3:00:33	There's no easy way to do this No easy way to do.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10833
3:00:38	This Oh Jack Ray showed up Cool Yeah Um.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10838
3:00:44	"Jack Ray says ""Uh even lawyers have continuing legal education requirements."" Yeah they."	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10844
3:00:50	Do Yeah Yeah Even teachers school teachers have you know they're required.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10850
3:00:57	To do a certain amount of learning every year Yeah There's just no easy way to do.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10857
3:01:05	This okay you just have to sort of bite the bullet and then try to figure it out.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10865
3:01:10	Yourself Okay you can ask people you trust You can ask experts you trust or.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10870
3:01:16	People who who who maybe know better than you Um and I would I would highly encourage that and that's one of the.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10876
3:01:23	Reasons we do this channel on these live streams is to take the questions.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10883
3:01:28	Like that are say maybe more difficult so that people can sort of okay get.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10888
3:01:36	Another perspective on it Yeah We don't expect you to believe us on everything we say What we do expect is that you.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10896
3:01:44	Take what we give you and then evaluate it weigh the evidence weigh the.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10904
3:01:50	Arguments and then come to the conclusion yourself Okay so that's what I would suggest here.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10910
3:01:58	Oh thank you very much for the super chat Very much.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10918

3:02:11	Field that's worth anything does this U here's the here's one of the.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10931
3:02:16	Things even fiction authors you know if they're not constantly learning their.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10936
3:02:22	Craft and it's a craft You know fiction writing is a craft If you're not.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10942
3:02:27	Constantly learning your craft and Stephen King said this once which I think is really.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10947
3:02:34	Interesting you know he said Stephen King you know he's he's written like many bestsellers He says he's constantly.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10954
3:02:40	Learning the craft of writing And he said that if you don't learn the craft of writing your writing.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10960
3:02:46	Gets stale And this is what happens to a lot of of say fiction authors that stop.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10966
3:02:54	Learning the craft is it gets stale Every person in every major.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10974
3:03:02	Field has to keep learning otherwise your knowledge gets.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10982
3:03:07	Stale.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10987
3:03:15	Mhm Yeah Yeah You.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=10995

3:03:30	Stephen King keeps needs to keep working on his writing Yeah I know it's scary but but.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=11010
3:03:36	It's true If you want to stay fresh as a writer you have to constantly keep working on your writing learning the.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=11016
3:03:44	Craft Pianists do you know pianist I mean anybody who.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=11024

3:04:35	Job of of getting into the nitty-gritty of say the context of the ancient.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=11075

3:05:10	Um learning the context of of ancient Israelites All right so I hope that.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=11110
3:05:17	Helps Thank you for the super chat Very much appreciate it Messianic Telmid for $5 Thank you for.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=11117
3:05:24	The super chat How similar is the creator God ta compared to Yahweh in the.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=11124
3:05:31	Bible only similar in one respect Okay Um the only similarity between Ta and.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=11131
3:05:39	Yahweh is the idea of fiat creation Okay Now what is fiat creation fiat creation.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=11139
3:05:48	Is the idea that you can create through the power of your voice or your thoughts.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=11148
3:05:57	Okay Uh in the Shabbaka Stila.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=11157
3:06:03	Uh there on the Shabbaka stone there is this sort of contest between the.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=11163
3:06:10	Mefit theology under Ta and the Helopllin theology under.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=11170
3:06:16	Rey And basically it's a sort of a a contest of who's the better.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=11176
3:06:22	God And Basically Ta says you know the me fights.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=11182
3:06:28	"Go ""Oh Ta is the better god because he's he's he creates through his thoughts and."	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=11188
3:06:34	"Through the power of his voice."" The sun god Rey is the inferior."	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=11194
3:06:41	God because he creates through the male sex act.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=11201
3:06:48	Okay So that's about the only similarity.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=11208
3:06:54	"Though between Ta and Yahweh is Yahweh says ""Let there be light."" And there was."	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=11214
3:07:01	Light You know let Yahweh creates the power of his.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=11221
3:07:06	Voice Ta also creates the power of his voice So so that's that's that's the only.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=11226
3:07:14	Similarity between Now everything else is different between the two.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=11234
3:07:19	Okay yahweh is a transcendent God Ta lives inside his creation He's an.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=11239
3:07:26	Imminent God Um Yahweh doesn't have a body Ta is.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=11246
3:07:32	A has a body and he's a mummy He's essentially a dead person wrapped up.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=11252
3:07:38	Okay So so that's where the similarities end.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=11258
3:07:45	Is just that's the only point where the two are similar is in that one sort of of intersection of fiat creation That's.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=11265
3:07:52	The only way they're similar Okay so I hope that helps Thank you very much for the super chat Very much appreciate.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=11272
3:08:00	It All right Esther again for $5 Thank you very much for the super chat How would the disciples have understood.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=11280
3:08:06	Mark 8:34 before the crucifixion okay let's go to Mark.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=11286
3:08:15	Mark.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=11295
3:08:20	"8 34 And the text reads ""And he summoned the m multitude."	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=11300
3:08:25	With his disciples and said to them if anyone wishes to come after me let him.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=11305
3:08:31	Deny himself take up his cross and follow me For whoever wishes to save his.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=11311
3:08:38	"Life shall lose it but whoever loses his life for my sake and the gospel shall save it.""."	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=11318
3:08:45	Okay How would this have been understood really really.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=11325
3:09:00	Poorly this would not have been received well at all.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=11340
3:09:06	Uh in fact what ends up happening is this sort of talk.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=11346
3:09:13	Um loses a lot of his followers.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=11353
3:09:19	Okay this is just over their heads Um if anyone wishes to come after.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=11359
3:09:27	Me let him deny himself and take up his cross take up his.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=11367
3:09:33	Execution Right I mean this is this is this is as to to a first century.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=11373
3:09:40	"Israelite this would be like saying the modern the modern equivalent of this was ""Hey if you want to come do what I do."	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=11380
3:09:48	Yeah you're going to have to to to give up everything and bring your electric.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=11388
3:09:56	"Chair."" Yeah Yeah How do you think that's going to go over."	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=11396
3:10:02	Um because the cross is the sign of the.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=11402
3:10:08	Executioner Okay Yeah you're going to be executed So not only are you going to.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=11408
3:10:14	Have to give up all the pleasures of this world you're going to be executed too Yeah This is this is not going to go.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=11414
3:10:21	Over well And it didn't Um in fact there comes to a a.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=11421
3:10:30	Point where you know where Christ is going to say to his.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=11430
3:10:37	"Disciples and his followers ""Yeah if you want to follow me you've got to eat my."	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=11437
3:10:44	"Flesh and drink my blood."" Well you know this."	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=11444
3:10:50	Is to a Jew is really abhorrent because it sounds like cannibalism.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=11450
3:10:57	"And the the the followers of Christ say ""Okay this saying is way too hard I."	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=11457
3:11:05	"Don't get it but it sounds weird I'm out of here."" So most of the followers end up."	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=11465
3:11:11	"Abandoning Christ And then Christ says to finally to his disciples ""Hey are you going to."	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=11471
3:11:17	"Abandon me too?"" And it I think it's Peter who says to Christ ""Well where where will we go."	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=11477
3:11:24	You have the words of life So in some ways this is going to.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=11484
3:11:30	Mark the division between who's a disciple and.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=11490
3:11:36	Who's a follower You know I kind I I I kind of I.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=11496
3:11:41	"Kind of bristle when I hear churches sort of rebrand themselves say ""Well."	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=11501
3:11:47	"We're not we're not Christians We're Christ followers."" [Music]."	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=11507
3:11:53	Oh what.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=11513
3:11:59	Huh cuz the followers of Christ they left you know when when the going got.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=11519
3:12:06	Rough they got going up and and left the.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=11526
3:12:13	Building It's the disciples who stuck around.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=11533
3:12:23	So so but it was stuff like this where he basically tells them hey yeah you.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=11543
3:12:30	Know you know verse 36 what does it profit a man to gain the whole world and.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=11550
3:12:35	Forfeit his soul yeah that's that's tough language.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=11555
3:12:43	"And it was really tough for an an a first century Israelite to to say ""Oh."	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=11563
3:12:50	Because they they I mean Jerusalem Judea have been a wash with.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=11570

3:14:59	Now He's claiming to bring you know a kind of Chrislam to the world It's like.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=11699
3:15:05	No no that just that's he's just another false teacher He's not he's not the antichrist He's just another false.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=11705
3:15:13	Teacher Yeah Um the earlier Yeah If you claim to be the.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=11713
3:15:20	Antichrist you're probably not Okay.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=11720
3:15:26	Um like we like we discussed in in Daniel chapter 11 you know the.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=11726
3:15:33	Antichrist is going to be Oh yeah He said he sub he made all.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=11733
3:15:39	Sorts of outrageous claims Yeah Um.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=11739
3:15:47	Um but like for example you know if you want to know who the antichrist.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=11747
3:15:52	Is the description was in was in Daniel 11 that we talked about today you.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=11752
3:15:58	Know his the the the god of the antichrist is is weapons.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=11758
3:16:05	Of war you know that's that's one of the things we see like in the book of revelation you know it talks about the.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=11765
3:16:11	Anti Christ and they say who can make war like the.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=11771
3:16:17	Antichrist like for example here's here's one of the things I think is is you know when when people start.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=11777
3:16:22	Guessing who is the antichrist okay let's see here let me see if I can find the passage that's okay.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=11782
3:16:35	But find this quickly if I can find this quickly I'll just.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=11795
3:16:53	All right One of the things about the.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=11813
3:16:59	Antichrist is his ability to make war Okay Revelation 12:17 And the dragon.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=11819
3:17:06	Emerged from the woman and went off to make war with the rest of her offspring who keeps the commandments of of Jesus.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=11826
3:17:13	Uh and hold to the testimony of Jesus.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=11833
3:17:19	Okay Uh Revelation 13:7 And it was given to him to make war.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=11839
3:17:25	With the saints and overcome them And the authority over every tribe and people and tongue and nation was given.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=11845
3:17:30	To him Okay and I saw the beast and the kings of the.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=11850
3:17:36	Earth and all their armies assembled to make war against him who sat upon the horse against his army Well one of the.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=11856
3:17:41	Things about the about the beast the antichrist is his ability to make war If.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=11861
3:17:48	He's no good at war he's not the antichrist Just.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=11868
3:17:53	Saying That's that's probably one of the major requirements of the Antichrist is he has to be good at warfare.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=11873
3:18:04	Yeah that's what rules out 90% of the politicians okay is most of the politicians are incompetent at.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=11884
3:18:12	War You know this is this is what I think is really really funny is.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=11892
3:18:27	Um every election Okay Bubble machine What would be the point of claiming to.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=11907
3:18:32	Be the antichrist it's a claim Okay this there there's actually there's a twisted there's a.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=11912
3:18:38	Twisted logic to this Okay most people who claim to be the antichrist also.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=11918
3:18:44	Claim to be the Christ Okay So the twisted logic here is if you.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=11924
3:18:53	Claim to be the Christ a false me if you claim to be a messiah and you claim to be his anti is.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=11933
3:19:02	His opposite The antichrist you can claim to be the.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=11942
3:19:08	Fulfillment or the consummation of the Christ consciousness.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=11948
3:19:15	That's the twisted logic in this okay is by claiming you be both the Christ and.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=11955
3:19:22	The Antichrist you can claim to be the consummation of both and therefore.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=11962
3:19:28	Everyone should follow you That's the twisted logic here.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=11968
3:19:36	So he's he's he's not I mean when when when these.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=11976
3:19:43	These these clowns claim to be the antichrist they're not claiming to be the devil incarnate You know are you the devil's.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=11983
3:19:51	Representative they're claiming to be the the ying and the.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=11991
3:19:58	Yang So they're they're claiming to be both the say the the the.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=11998
3:20:06	The peaceloving elements of the Christ and the powerful elements of the dark.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=12006
3:20:13	Side of the Christ the.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=12013
3:20:20	Antichrist Uh bubble machine So Mary Sue got complex issues Yeah Yeah.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=12020
3:20:29	Mama Yikes They're two timing trying to play both sides Exactly Yeah Those who claim.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=12029
3:20:35	To be both Christ and Antichrist they're they're playing both sides.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=12035
3:20:41	They're infusing they're they're they're trying to infuse say this idea with.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=12041
3:20:54	Um with this sort of say eastern motif of say dowoism.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=12054
3:21:01	So they're they're trying to appeal to they're basically importing a kind of Dowoism into Christianity and then.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=12061
3:21:09	Trying to be the representative of Christianity through that importation Uh keeps learning will the.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=12069
3:21:16	Antichrist be a Jew not necessarily It's possible but not.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=12076
3:21:22	Necessarily Uh we're not sure what his ethnicity will be Some people have.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=12082
3:21:28	Speculated that he will be sort of a representative of of the tribe of Dan.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=12088
3:21:33	The idea being that tribe of Dan is excluded But that.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=12093
3:21:39	That's that's an inference and I don't think it's a very good inference So maybe he's a Jew maybe he isn't.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=12099
3:21:46	Doesn't we we're not sure We can't be sure Um the Bible just doesn't tell us here.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=12106
3:22:00	Okay So.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=12120

3:22:37	Anti-semite Okay He'll be an anti-semite he'll be anti-Christian he'll be both.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=12157
3:22:43	Um not necessarily atheistic Um.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=12163
3:22:50	Um but he might have pretenses of atheism It for him it just seems to be that from the looks of it.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=12170
3:22:57	That he's going to sidestep.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=12177

3:25:24	Messianic Talbad for $5 Thank you for the super chat How similar are the fights and squables of Egyptian gods.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=12324
3:25:31	Similar to those of Greek mythology they're not that similar to be.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=12331
3:25:37	Honest Um Egyptian gods tend not to fight except in pretty special.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=12337
3:25:46	Circumstances The only gods that we have on record actually fighting are.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=12346
3:25:53	Um the the of course the the the contesting between Horus and Seth and.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=12353
3:26:01	That's over kingship of Egypt Then we also have the daily the daily.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=12361
3:26:09	Battle of the sun god with the serpent Apous All right And that's pretty much.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=12369
3:26:15	The limits of fights and squables between Egyptian.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=12375
3:26:22	Gods So there isn't this constant warfare happening between the gods like you do find in the Greek mythology In.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=12382
3:26:29	Greek mythology you do find constant infighting and bickering and battles and.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=12389
3:26:36	Conniving and intrigue You know Mars oh sorry Uh Aries.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=12396
3:26:42	You know gets on the battlefield and of the gods and then cowers out and runs Um.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=12402
3:26:48	No no you don't find any of that Not in Egyptian in Egyptian.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=12408
3:26:55	Mythology anyway.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=12415
3:27:02	Okay so I hope that helps Thank you for the super chat Very much appreciate.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=12422
3:27:09	It Right Messi Adam Talmud for $5 Thank you for the super chat Uh did Egyptian gods physically get.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=12429
3:27:17	Women pregnant like the Olympians no Okay Um and there's a.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=12437
3:27:23	Reason There's a reason Now there's a no and a yes answer to.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=12443
3:27:29	This too Okay if it's a king.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=12449
3:27:34	Um the gods were said to have played a role in the conception of a.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=12454
3:27:41	King And how that works was the god Cane put.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=12461
3:27:50	The soul of the king on the potter's wheel created man on the potter's.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=12470
3:27:55	Wheel and then Ammon Alman Ray and Moot.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=12475
3:28:01	Had mommy and daddy time conceive the.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=12481
3:28:07	King which the great queen and the physical.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=12487
3:28:13	King when they had their king and queen private.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=12493
3:28:19	Time conceived and then the gods implanted.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=12499
3:28:24	The baby god king came into the great queen and she got pregnant that way.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=12504
3:28:34	Okay so that's the exception The rule is generally no.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=12514
3:28:42	Okay So that that's the only case where you have a god.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=12522
3:28:49	Um getting a woman pregnant is through the conception of a.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=12529
3:28:55	King Everyone else was conceived the normal way Okay Um but here's the thing And.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=12535
3:29:03	Here's the reason why you had less claims to um.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=12543
3:29:10	Uh physical conception by a god too And the reason is because in.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=12550
3:29:21	Um in Greek society there was a stigma attached to.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=12561
3:29:28	Unwed motherhood Okay because there was a stigma attached to it in Greek.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=12568
3:29:34	Hellenistic society Uh women did often claim that they were impregnated by a god.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=12574
3:29:42	Essentially fooled by a god shaped like a man.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=12582
3:29:48	Who you know bent her will and you know seduced her because of his divine.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=12588
3:29:56	Powers and she conceived through divine means Okay.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=12596
3:30:05	Now unwed motherhood in Egypt did not carry that.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=12605
3:30:13	Stigma Because it didn't carry that stigma there were very few claims of.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=12613
3:30:20	Divine conception among the general population.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=12620
3:30:27	So it's a cultural reason why it didn't happen in Egypt.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=12627
3:30:32	You you got those claims in the ancient world where there were these stigmas.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=12632
3:30:37	Okay So where you didn't have the stigma there was there was a there was none.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=12637
3:30:43	Of that those claims of say divine conception or very few at any.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=12643
3:30:52	Rate and Egypt had no as I said Egypt did not have that.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=12652
3:30:58	That stigma applied to single motherhood Now that's not saying single motherhood.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=12658
3:31:03	Was wasn't hard It was very very difficult and it was in every.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=12663
3:31:10	Culture and it did force a woman to do.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=12670
3:31:15	Certain things that she wouldn't have had to do normally But because there was no stigma.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=12675
3:31:22	Attached to single motherhood in Egypt she could still.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=12682
3:31:28	Marry Okay because there was no stigma attached to single motherhood So she could still marry a.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=12688
3:31:35	Man and there were avenues out for where she could say pursue a a normal.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=12695
3:31:43	Life though being a single mother was not a end of the line in Egyptian.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=12703
3:31:50	Culture whereas say in Greek culture and in Israelite culture yeah it was it was.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=12710
3:31:57	A big problem if that happened.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=12717
3:32:03	So.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=12723
3:32:08	Okay so so anyway I hope that answers your question Thank you very much for the super chat very much.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=12728
3:32:24	Appreciated Okay Daniel for $5 Thank you very much for the super chat First Kings 3:2 Would one of these.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=12744
3:32:31	High places be Mount Eel let's talk about that All right Um first.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=12751
3:32:40	Kings So first kings 3 verse two All.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=12760
3:32:50	Right And it talks about here the people were still sacrificing on the high.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=12770
3:32:55	Places because there was no house built for the name of the Lord until these day those days All right So it's getting.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=12775
3:33:03	Ready to we're getting here ready This is the during the time of Solomon and they're getting ready to build the.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=12783
3:33:09	Temple Now it would not have included Mount.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=12789
3:33:15	Eel Why because the Mount Eel site only lasted about 50 years.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=12795
3:33:25	Mount Eelles site was kind of remote for it to be a good high.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=12805
3:33:30	Place Now it could have become a high place It had all the potential to be a.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=12810
3:33:37	High place It just ended not being a high place because it as I said it only.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=12817
3:33:43	Lasted for about 50 years and then it was shut down You know they built two altars.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=12823
3:33:48	There and that was it you know so you know its span of time at Mount Ebel.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=12828
3:33:55	Contextually was the late Bronze 2 early Iron Age one.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=12835
3:34:01	So you know by the time I mean the conquest hadn't even.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=12841
3:34:07	Finished when by the time Mount Eel had shut down So Mount Ebel didn't last long as a.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=12847
3:34:15	Site it it was a really short-lived site So it wouldn't count as the high.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=12855
3:34:20	One of the high places in First Kings 3:2 Um in First Kings 3:2 you're already.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=12860
3:34:26	Talking about 200 years after the.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=12866
3:34:31	Conquest So yeah you're really not you're really.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=12871
3:34:36	You're really talking about other sites at this point for high places Now let's talk about what a high place.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=12876
3:34:43	Is because there's a lot of confusion about what a high place is.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=12883
3:34:48	Okay high place is not a place where people worshiped pagan.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=12888
3:34:54	Gods What a high place is is and this is not talking about elevation Okay a high.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=12894
3:35:03	Place is not necessarily on a mountain or a hill.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=12903
3:35:09	It's not high in geography it's high in.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=12909
3:35:19	Religion Okay So.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=12919
3:35:24	Uh it's it's so we're not talking about elevation here Now we do see this language happen like.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=12924
3:35:31	For example when Elijah you know you know goes from.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=12931
3:35:38	Um Jerusalem to Hebrron Okay you know he.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=12938
3:35:43	Is sent to descend from Jerusalem to Hebrron Well Hebron's actually higher in.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=12943
3:35:50	Elevation but religiously he is going from the high place in a higher place religiously in.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=12950
3:35:57	Jerusalem to the lower place religiously in Hebron.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=12957
3:36:03	Okay Um or not Hebron Bethl Bethl sorry So.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=12963
3:36:10	Um so it's it's a high place here is not talking about a place of.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=12970
3:36:15	Elevation but it's a place of religious uh.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=12975
3:36:22	Service Okay Now what a high place also is though is it's aberrant.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=12982
3:36:29	Yahwehism Okay It's a Yahwehism It's basically people going into these.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=12989
3:36:36	Little cult sites and worshiping selfstyled.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=12996
3:36:43	Yahwehism Okay.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=13003
3:36:48	So so basically like Shiloh Shiloh was a high place Okay It's it was a it was a cult.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=13008
3:36:57	Site It was re- rededicated for the for the ha tabernacle Um it's not an.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=13017
3:37:04	Elevated site but an ele high sight in elevation but it is a cult site that's a high place.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=13024
3:37:15	Um basically places that had their own private Yahweh temples like at Hebrron.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=13035
3:37:22	Like at Bethl you know those are those are high places.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=13042
3:37:31	So it's a place where people are not necessarily it's not a place where.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=13051
3:37:36	Yahweh was designated to be worshiped but people decided to build temples and.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=13056
3:37:43	Chapels to Yahweh and worship there anyway and they're doing it their own.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=13063
3:37:50	Way So what we're talking about here when we talk about high places is selfstyled Yahweh worship.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=13070
3:37:57	Okay The best way to to describe it is aberant Yahwehism It's not pagan as such It's.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=13077
3:38:05	Not polytheistic as such It's still Yahweh worship It's just Yahweh worship.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=13085
3:38:12	That's not following the rules Okay So I hope that helps Thank you very.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=13092
3:38:19	Much for super chat Very much.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=13099
3:38:24	Appreciated Okay Next one here from Daniel for $10 Thank you for the super.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=13104
3:38:30	Chat Are there any known ancient neareastern documents which were written composed in.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=13110
3:38:38	A way that source critics propose the penetuk was written JP D plus he's.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=13118
3:38:46	Talking here about the documentary hypothesis the idea.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=13126
3:38:51	That you had multiple sources that are then sort of mashed.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=13131
3:38:58	Together and then redacted constantly as they're being mashed together The short answer to this is.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=13138
3:39:05	No There is not a single document that was ever composed this way in the.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=13145
3:39:11	History of mankind Okay not one I have I have at least I am unaware.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=13151
3:39:19	Of any document that was composed this way Now let's take one that has probably.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=13159
3:39:26	The longest pedigree of of of transmission.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=13166
3:39:32	And of composition longer than the Bible Okay let's talk about the book of the dead.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=13172
3:39:41	Because we all love talking about the book of the dead Don't open the book of the.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=13181
3:39:46	Dead Don't open the book.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=13186
3:39:52	That was very well done Yeah Okay Don't Don't open it.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=13192
3:40:00	[Laughter] So what do we have here with the book of the dead it started off as the pyramid.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=13200
3:40:07	Texts The pyramid texts are basically a collection of magic spells Okay so you.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=13207
3:40:13	Do have a collection of various spells and documents there Okay they're written.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=13213
3:40:20	On pyramids Okay fine.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=13220
3:40:26	Now that then goes into the coffin text Well the basically they go into the.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=13226
3:40:33	Pyramids copy those texts and then start copying onto to coffins Not complete.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=13233
3:40:41	They're not complete text on the coffins but they take samples of these and they put them on on on the coffins Okay and.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=13241
3:40:50	Then and they change slightly over time but you know some of that is organic.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=13250
3:40:55	Change It's not it's not say intentional redaction as such They're not redacting those texts on when they put them on.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=13255
3:41:02	Coffins but they are modifying them in slight ways to make them more appropriate for the person in the.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=13262
3:41:09	Coffin Okay Then they take those coffin texts and they sort of gather them together again to make the book of the.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=13269
3:41:17	Dead And the book of the dead is codified.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=13277
3:41:24	Into spells again And those spells remain pretty persistent over.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=13284
3:41:32	Time They don't change much over thousands of years.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=13292
3:41:39	So that's the closest parallel we have.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=13299
3:41:45	To a documentary hypothesis scenario That's the closest we.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=13305
3:41:51	Got where we have one set of text that are compiled modified.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=13311
3:41:59	Slightly and then recompiled again But there's no ongoing process of.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=13319
3:42:06	Redaction here There's no schools of redaction I don't know I mean the whole.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=13326
3:42:14	Idea that that I you know you got these schools of redaction of say each represented by four different schools or.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=13334
3:42:21	More than that Yeah There's absolutely no evidence.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=13341
3:42:26	Of any historical document ever going through this.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=13346
3:42:32	Process None This is all theory It's all 19th century.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=13352
3:42:43	Theory So there's to my knowledge there's no ancient neareastern.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=13363
3:42:48	Document that was composed in this way like the source critics propose.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=13368
3:42:56	So this is one of the reasons why I think that they need better evidence for their views because you know it's just.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=13376
3:43:03	It's all suppositional It's all hypothetical And for me that's that's.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=13383
3:43:19	BS Yeah It adds no value to interpretation either So.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=13399
3:43:36	"Scott Warworth says ""J Source or Sumerian anthropomorphism theme combined with Eources."	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=13416
3:43:41	"Uh influence from Egypt."" Yeah I I I think that's that's complete baloney Let's not misconstrue what's going on."	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=13421
3:43:48	Here without as without precedent Yeah I think that's complete baloney I I don't think that there's there's any Sumerian.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=13428
3:43:55	From J Source because that's that's like too archaic No I think that's that's nonsense I think that's complete.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=13435
3:44:02	Nonsense So you know that's I mean that's ad hocing it And if.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=13442
3:44:08	You're going to ad hawk it Yeah Yeah I'm just going to I'm just going to shoot that down because because Yeah that's.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=13448
3:44:13	There's no evidence or warrant for that Just baloney.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=13453
3:44:22	"Keeps learning goes ""But the documentary hypothesis is still the mainstream view in scholarship isn't it?"" Um not so much."	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=13462
3:44:29	Anymore Not so much anymore Um only in North America Okay Yeah In in.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=13469
3:44:37	The North America it's still the majority view Okay In Europe it's not the majority view anymore And in Israel.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=13477
3:44:43	It's not the majority view anymore Uh it's been pretty much supplanted by the supplementary hypothesis really the.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=13483
3:44:49	Supplementary hypothesis is is what sort of the is is basically given given the.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=13489
3:44:57	Documentary hypothesis a a.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=13497
3:45:03	Browbeating Scott Waran goes the majority of academics side with the documentary hypothesis Of course they do.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=13503
3:45:09	Because that's what they were taught That's what they were taught in Sarah They can't all be at Hawking Why not.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=13509
3:45:15	That doesn't follow No that doesn't follow at all They could all be.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=13515
3:45:21	Wrong you know.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=13521
3:45:27	Yeah You know you can you can have you can have a majority view that's that's completely wrong I mean that's happened.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=13527
3:45:34	Many times You just go look at Jericho okay for for the longest time they said.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=13534
3:45:41	There was no Bronze Age Jericho Well well that was Well that that aged well didn't it.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=13541
3:45:48	Okay So you know and frankly I mean here's here's.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=13548
3:45:53	The thing The the problem with the documentary hypothesis has always been how do you determine what's.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=13553
3:46:00	Redacted what's the criteria for determining a redaction that's the problem with it.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=13560
3:46:09	There is no objective criteria It's all subjective and it all shifts Every.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=13569
3:46:15	Documentary hypothesis scholar has a different criteria for.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=13575
3:46:21	Redaction You know it used to be that it was the names Oh that's where.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=13581
3:46:27	We get the the acronym J P and D You know you know you had the.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=13587
3:46:32	Deuteronomy code Well that's your D source You got your priestly code that's your P source If it used the name Yahweh.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=13592
3:46:39	Well that's that's your J source And if it used Elohim it used that's your E source Well that was discovered to be.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=13599
3:46:45	Complete baloney That was complete baloney So what did they do they go to another.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=13605
3:46:51	Source instead Oh well we were going to use this method instead And then that was turned out to be baloney too Now.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=13611
3:46:57	It's doulets Oh anything that looks like a repetition It's got to be now evidence.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=13617
3:47:03	Of redaction It is complete baloney Doulets Yeah Yeah The whole idea.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=13623
3:47:11	That if you have a a reputation of some kind or close to rep duplicate of some kind Yeah that's no that's that's.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=13631
3:47:19	Nonsense It's utter.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=13639
3:47:26	Nonsense Yeah Um Jonathan Walker says some duplicates are actually.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=13646
3:47:33	Self-explan Yeah they do they do explain themselves which is why when you've got.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=13653
3:47:40	You know these supposed doulets I mean you've got to be careful about this.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=13660
3:47:46	Because a lot of those have an explanation that you know does not.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=13666
3:47:52	Require redaction you know the idea I mean a lot of them will say hey you know.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=13672
3:47:58	You know who who sold Joseph into slavery was the Ishelites or the Medidionites when the text clearly tells.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=13678
3:48:04	You that the Ishelites are Midianites So it there there's no.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=13684
3:48:10	Warrant there for redaction And that's why I think the.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=13690
3:48:16	Documentary hypothesis is pure baloney I have not yet seen a single.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=13696
3:48:23	Instance where there's a compelling case of reduction Now there might be Okay and.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=13703
3:48:32	I'm not I'm not discounting here the updating of spellings Okay I'm not talking about spellings when I'm talking about redaction I'm talking merging of.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=13712
3:48:40	Documents where they change the content to make it.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=13720
3:48:47	Fit It's just oh my gosh Yeah mama Bilbo wrote some Froto.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=13727
3:48:56	Froto wrote some and Sam Weiss added the ending Yeah Yeah It's just no I it is.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=13736
3:49:03	Complete baloney It is the document hypothesis is complete baloney There is.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=13743
3:49:08	No ancient text that ever followed that method of of of.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=13748
3:49:14	Construction And there's no there's no warrant for this There's no.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=13754
3:49:20	Evidence to support this view It's complete nonsense Utter.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=13760
3:49:28	Nonsense.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=13768
3:49:33	And not only that it's bad exesus.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=13773
3:49:40	The whole idea is based on only.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=13780
3:49:46	Oh yeah Oh yeah Well it follows so many logical fallacies too like the one.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=13786
3:49:52	Person one name thing Um it it follows say the one place one one one toponym.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=13792
3:50:00	Fallacy I mean there's so many of those fallacies that it employs Like I even.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=13800

4:00:39	Expensive if you had to buy it But yeah the big question for me is.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=14439
4:00:46	Who got his slides who got his photographs.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=14446

4:00:57	Slides of of all these ramicide inscriptions in in.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=14457
4:01:03	Egypt And a lot of those those inscriptions don't exist anymore because they were destroyed.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=14463
4:01:11	So I'm always I'm wondering who's got his photographs because it was stipulated in.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=14471
4:01:19	His will that those photographs were be were to be destroyed.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=14479

4:01:41	Those All right.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=14501
4:01:47	So well I mean he could have changed his will too at the last minute on that I hope he.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=14507
4:01:54	Did I think I think Paul basically got through to.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=14514
4:02:00	Him because because the library was also supposed to be disposed of and at any.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=14520
4:02:05	Point I'm I'm thrilled Tinddale House got the library I hope they got the photographs.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=14525
4:02:23	"Too Yeah Okay Um Tyler X9 asks ""Any."	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=14543

4:04:06	So yes there is evidence for this in the ancient near.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=14646
4:04:12	East So I hope that helps Thank you very much for the super chat Very much.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=14652
4:04:19	Appreciated Okay mysterious fungus for $10 Thank you for the super chat Uh are there lines between specific.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=14659
4:04:27	Clan begins and ends set in stone or is it more subjective like one would consider B to be part of A's clan while.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=14667
4:04:35	Others see A and B as two clans Um okay a division of a clan can can be.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=14675
4:04:43	Subjective Okay Um when when we talk about clans.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=14683
4:04:52	Um clans are subdivided into clades Okay they don't talk about clades as much.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=14692
4:05:00	Um but essentially a clan is divided into multiple.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=14700
4:05:06	Clades and then clades become divide into families Okay Uh the chief tends to.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=14706
4:05:14	Be along the main line or the main caid Okay.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=14714
4:05:19	So when two clades split a a clan can divide into two two.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=14719
4:05:26	Clans Okay So it becomes really subjective at that.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=14726
4:05:33	Point because at that point whoever it becomes like for example if one cate has.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=14733
4:05:39	A member in it that becomes super famous super well-known does really really.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=14739
4:05:44	Incredible things a new clan can be started just from that.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=14744
4:05:52	So so so it's it's it's subjective when.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=14752
4:05:58	Clans say a begin or end I mean here's the thing A clan a clan ends pretty much.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=14758
4:06:06	When the last member dies That's that's not a subjective ending Okay when the last member dies of.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=14766
4:06:13	That clan the clan ends Okay so.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=14773
4:06:22	Uh Jonathan Walker would the Claves be grandparents and the clan be great grandparents.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=14782
4:06:29	Um yes it can be that but it can also be a lot further back too Uh like for.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=14789
4:06:36	Example Scottish clans tend to be made of many many many clades that go.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=14796
4:06:43	Back a thousand years Okay So um sort of at its sort of.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=14803
4:06:51	Shortest um your.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=14811
4:06:57	Greatgrandparents would be your great great grand your great grand your.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=14817
4:07:03	Greatgrandfather can start a clan Okay because you got four generations there.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=14823
4:07:09	You got your great-grandfather's generation got your grandfather's generation you got your dad's generation.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=14829
4:07:14	And then you've got you Four generations that forms a clan right.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=14834
4:07:20	There Okay Now if your greatgrand uh father had.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=14840
4:07:30	Multiple sons each of those families would be a.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=14850
4:07:36	Clay underneath the greatgrandfather Okay so that's how it works Now your.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=14856
4:07:45	Clan chief will descend down one of those clades.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=14865
4:07:50	Usually the clay to the eldest son Usually not guaranteed but.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=14870
4:07:57	Usually Okay so that's how it would generally.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=14877
4:08:04	Work Now how a new clan starts is very subjective Again you.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=14884
4:08:11	Have to have a progenitor and that progenitor is.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=14891
4:08:16	Usually somebody who does something of note.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=14896
4:08:24	El Bunny is up to something All right it is midnight Yeah.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=14904
4:08:30	So she wants to be fed So we probably will wrap this up pretty soon here Okay.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=14910
4:08:36	So anyway Mysterious Fungus I hope that helped Uh starting a new clan subjective.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=14916
4:08:42	Ending a new clan not subjective Everyone dies Okay.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=14922
4:08:54	Okay BC has a member question here Many hauntings feature ghosts of dead.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=14934
4:08:59	People If some of our true manifestation do you think these are actual people or.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=14939
4:09:04	Demons masquerading okay Um that.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=14944
4:09:10	Is there's a lot of options here Okay Um there's when we talk about hauntings.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=14950
4:09:19	Uh by ghosts it's not even necessarily dead.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=14959
4:09:27	People There's also a whole class of hauntings by living people Okay In fact.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=14967
4:09:35	There was a a a a I think a threebook set of of I have this set called.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=14975
4:09:46	Ghosts of the living It talks about hauntings of spirits of people who.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=14986
4:09:53	Hadn't died who were really alive who were still alive at the time of the haunting.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=14993
4:10:01	Um so there's the there's a one class of ghost that seems to not even have been.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=15001
4:10:07	Dead yet Okay which is really weird Okay I.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=15007
4:10:12	Have to admit that's weird But it's also really well documented too That just makes it weirder not less.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=15012
4:10:19	Weird Okay so you've got hauntings that are from living people Then you got the dead.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=15019
4:10:27	People Okay Now once you talk about dead people this is where things sort of get.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=15027
4:10:33	Hazy And I mean hazy as in there's lots of possibilities Okay You've got the.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=15033
4:10:39	Spirits of dead people That's probably the most prosaic.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=15039
4:10:44	Explanation You've got engrammatic manifestations Now what's an.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=15044
4:10:51	Engrammatic manifestation it's sort of an imprint on an.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=15051
4:10:56	Area So think of it kind of this way It's kind of like a house that has the.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=15056
4:11:03	Same manifestation every night and it's sort of a recording Think of it like a.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=15063
4:11:10	Tape recording where you see a woman like here's just.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=15070
4:11:16	An example So you go to this old Wild West mansion and you see a woman dressed.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=15076
4:11:21	In a 19th century dress who walks from one end of the hall to the.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=15081
4:11:27	Other and she does the same thing every single.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=15087
4:11:33	Night Okay there's no you you can't talk to.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=15093
4:11:39	Her She doesn't respond to anything It's just the same manifestation every.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=15099
4:11:46	Night the same way It's more like a tape recording than it is a something.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=15106
4:11:56	Interactive Um these are sort of manifestations like you see for example with shadow people Shadow people don't.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=15116
4:12:03	Tend to interact with their environment You know they're just you.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=15123
4:12:10	Just see it and it's just there's no interaction Yeah Mama says an echo Yeah.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=15130
4:12:17	It's kind of like an echo So that's another possible manifestation of ghost is not they're not a they're not a.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=15137
4:12:24	Spirit as such but there's sort of an a sort of an imprint on reality an echo a.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=15144
4:12:30	Shadow but there's there's nothing there Okay.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=15150
4:12:37	The third a third possibility is a manifestation by a spirit.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=15157
4:12:43	Critter and you know this is where I say a demon or a lesser spirit will masquerade as a.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=15163
4:12:51	Dead person Now these manifestations tend to.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=15171
4:12:56	Be interactive They are targeting you per.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=15176
4:13:03	Se They know you Bubble machine Princess Leia hologram Yeah Oh yeah Some of these.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=15183
4:13:10	Some of the ghost manifestations are like Princess Leia holograms They'll say the same thing.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=15190
4:13:17	Every time and they just.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=15197
4:13:23	Uh Jonathan Walker an extradimensional quantum shadow Yeah it's a possibility You know it's a possibility.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=15203
4:13:30	Um as I said that final one where where it's a masquerading demon an un a.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=15210
4:13:37	Familiar spirit or an unclean spirit you know they'll they will masquerade.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=15217
4:13:44	Um they tend to target children too That's another thing is the ones that.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=15224
4:13:50	Are actually masquerading a lot of them will target children or.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=15230
4:13:56	Minors because they're vulnerable.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=15236
4:14:07	Um Harry Stark what even are ghosts ghosts are a form of apparition of a.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=15247
4:14:15	Spirit being Okay so it's an apparition.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=15255
4:14:25	Um yeah it's it's it's I I think of the possibilities here I think the least.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=15265
4:14:32	Likely possibility Um so basically what what's a ghost let's get back to what's a ghost.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=15272
4:14:39	Let's define this here Ghost is an apparition So it's something you.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=15279
4:14:44	Perceive A human being perceives this as a spirit being of some kind They're not.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=15284
4:14:53	You They're a non-physical being that you perceive Okay so it's a ghost is.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=15293
4:15:01	Something that could be heard or seen or felt but it's in some.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=15301
4:15:08	Way a human being experiences a being or a remnant of a.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=15308
4:15:15	Being that's not physically there.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=15315
4:15:22	Okay So that was that that that defines what we mean.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=15322
4:15:30	By when we're talking about ghosts Okay Now of the of the possibilities.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=15330
4:15:37	We laid out here I f find that the whole idea that these are spirits of the dead to be the least compelling.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=15337
4:15:44	Explanation All right I don't think spirits of the dead return as ghosts Okay which leaves the three other.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=15344
4:15:51	Possibilities And I think any of those three possibilities are still sort of on the table Either they're spirits of.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=15351
4:15:58	The living They're they're basically imprints upon.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=15358
4:16:05	Reality or they are masquerading spirit critters I think any one of those three.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=15365
4:16:11	Is a possibility Um but it's going to depend on the particular manifestation and the.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=15371
4:16:18	Circumstances surrounding it So I don't think one explanation covers.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=15378
4:16:24	It all So I think there's a range of possibilities.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=15384
4:16:32	Here Okay So I hope that.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=15392
4:16:37	Um he says do you think I I I think that just to get back to.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=15397
4:16:44	The the the question here if some accounts are true manifest I think some of those accounts are true.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=15404
4:16:49	Manifestations Okay Hey look I've seen one I've seen.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=15409
4:16:55	One so I'm not willing to dismiss all of.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=15415
4:17:01	The accounts Yeah Yeah The Bible mentions them as.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=15421
4:17:07	Well So are.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=15427
4:17:14	Yeah Yeah I Yeah It is it is part of the biblical worldview that these things exist How.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=15434
4:17:21	They exist is a different.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=15441
4:17:29	"Question Harry Stark says ""Wow David saw a real demon."" No I not say I didn't say a real demon I said I saw a ghost I saw."	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=15449

4:21:11	Serious and a lot of people have seen them You know and this is one of the things Irving Finkele said you know Um.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=15671
4:21:19	Interestingly enough um Irving Finkele started looking into this because you know he started going you.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=15679
4:21:26	Know he started researching he found these things in the Kaoifor tablets and you know he started going to parties and.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=15686
4:21:32	You know he said you know I got this crazy thing I want to.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=15692
4:21:37	Talk about and you know and and Finkele would go to.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=15697
4:21:42	"To these high-end parties and he says ""Yeah you know I I heard this story."	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=15702
4:21:48	About about somebody you know seeing a ghost you know and and what do you think about that and he said you know you'd be.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=15708
4:21:54	In party six people and the sooner or later somebody in that group will come up to you and say hey you know what i.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=15714
4:22:00	Didn't want to say this in front of the others but yeah I've seen.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=15720
4:22:07	One Um Harry Stark have any ghosts spirits demons been recorded on camera.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=15727
4:22:14	Some of the activity has Okay Now that activity has always been contested Um um.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=15734
4:22:22	So it's it's hard to verify any recording as such Um like for example.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=15742
4:22:30	Some poltergeist activity hasn't been recorded on camera Um I mean I've seen poltergeist.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=15750
4:22:37	Activity myself So again stuff flying off the shelves at West Elm.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=15757
4:22:43	So you're not going to see you're more likely not to see ghosts spirits or.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=15763
4:22:49	Demons on recording equipment Um they're not corporeal They need the human mind to be.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=15769
4:22:54	Visible So that's not going to manifest on camera Poltergeist activity does because.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=15774
4:23:02	Uh physical objects fly off the shelves So.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=15782
4:23:08	Um that's that's something you're going to see Other than that though the the ghosts demons and spirits you're.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=15788
4:23:13	Probably not going to see that on camera Okay.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=15793
4:23:20	So all right So let's move on here and do the last super chats here and then we'll call it a.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=15800

4:23:55	Um you have to be careful with cats adding cats and bunnies together.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=15835
4:24:01	Sometimes they get along royally sometimes they don't Depends on the bunny depends on.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=15841
4:24:06	The cat All right But they I would be.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=15846
4:24:12	More likely to trust a cat with a bunny than a dog with a bunny Okay Dogs and bunnies are are predator and prey Cats.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=15852
4:24:20	And bunnies can get along especially if they're similar in.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=15860

4:29:02	Names that they were already familiar with I mean we see this even in North America You know there's like 50.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=16142
4:29:08	Springfields in in the United States 50.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=16148
4:29:13	Springfields almost one I mean one per state essentially although some states have.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=16153
4:29:20	Two So so yeah it's it's just one of those.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=16160
4:29:26	Things that we just have to kind of accept So I hope that helps Thank you.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=16166
4:29:33	Very much The super chat very much appreciated And this is the final super chat of the night.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=16173
4:29:39	"Here Uh yeah mama says ""America's done the same thing Check how many states."	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=16179
4:29:45	Have a Lawrence a Greenville and a Lincoln Yeah Yeah.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=16185
4:29:54	Exactly Yeah How many lakesides are there i said Springfield Yeah I mean Springfield is.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=16194
4:30:01	One of the most common town names in the United States Yeah Yeah There's a lot more.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=16201
4:30:07	Springfields than Poison Lakes but there are a few Poison Lakes.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=16207
4:30:14	Yeah people ignored it too until he ended up dead Okay Jonathan Walker for $5 Thank.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=16214
4:30:21	You for the super chat And this is the last super chat of the night here Uh it's 12:30 already so it's probably a.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=16221
4:30:26	Good time to end Uh he asks do the colors in Exodus 26:1 give us clues of.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=16226
4:30:35	How the cheraban were woven in an Egyptian context let's take a look at that All right.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=16235
4:30:44	Exodus it's a good question Exodus 26 And this is the um.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=16244
4:30:50	Building of the tabernacle All right Exodus 26:1 Moreover you shall make the tabernacle.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=16250
4:30:56	With 10 curtains of fine twisted linen and blue and purple and scarlet.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=16256
4:31:03	Material And you shall make them with them ch make them with cherubim the work of a skillful workman Okay.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=16263
4:31:11	Um the colors don't tell us a lot.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=16271
4:31:17	Um there's a couple ways they could have made this Uh blue and purple were.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=16277
4:31:24	Synthetic could be obtained through cement synthetic pigments like Egyptian.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=16284
4:31:32	Blue and Egyptian purple Okay And I do have an example of Egyptian blue right.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=16292
4:31:38	Here Tada That's Egyptian blue And it's.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=16298
4:31:43	Blue It's a light sky blue with kind of a It's kind of a cool blue It looks kind.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=16303
4:31:50	Of looks warm on the screen but it's a really a cool blue Um if I take it keep it out of the the direct.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=16310
4:31:58	Um Yeah it's sort of a robins egg blue but it's kind of I'll keep it out of direct light here so you can kind of see.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=16318
4:32:03	The color better But yeah that's about that So that's Egyptian blue.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=16323
4:32:10	So it's an and it's an artificial pigment and the Egyptians did make this stuff So it's possible they could have.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=16330
4:32:17	Used Egyptian blue for this or Egyptian purple which is similar Okay Or they could have used.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=16337
4:32:26	Um it's made from copper Yeah it's it's a copper pigment.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=16346
4:32:31	Yeah it's copper Uh it's copper combined with natron and then reduced in.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=16351
4:32:40	Furnace Yeah it's it's a really beautiful blue It's also very ephemeral too though Unfortunately it fades to.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=16360
4:32:48	White They also could have used turquoise They also could have taken.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=16368
4:32:53	Turquoise and crushed it and turned that into a blue pigment as well because Egyptian blue is a synthetic replacement.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=16373
4:33:00	For turquoise as a pigment which is also a copper.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=16380
4:33:08	Fault Oh yeah Oh yes Yeah You did have you did have glass I mean this is um.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=16388
4:33:16	The the birth of Egyptian blue is a result of.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=16396
4:33:23	Um first of all theance theance technology coupled with.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=16403
4:33:30	Um glass making technology.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=16410
4:33:35	So so so the the colors here Oh and scarlet.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=16415
4:33:42	That's from an insect Um I think it's was cockid something like that Red.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=16422
4:33:49	Scarlet Yeah it's it's an insect that's that's crushed to make this.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=16429
4:33:56	"Pigment Yeah you have to crush a lot of them Yeah Uh mama asks ""Is it UV light that makes."	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=16436
4:34:03	"It fade?"" No it's actually dehydration Um it's a it's it's a it's a."	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=16443
4:34:09	Pigment that has that's bound to six.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=16449
4:34:15	Water H2O ions Okay So what happens is the as the pigment starts losing.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=16455
4:34:24	Water it fades to white kind of in the same way that copper sulfate copper sulfate when.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=16464
4:34:32	It's hydrris is beautiful blue crystals but when it starts losing water ions and.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=16472
4:34:38	Becomes inhydrous it turns to white So it's more of a matter of.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=16478
4:34:44	Dehydration that causes it to fade.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=16484
4:34:49	Now with that said the colors here doesn't give us a really good indication.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=16489
4:34:55	Of of how the chair been woven but it's a great question.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=16495
4:35:06	"Um mama asks ""So if you use Egyptian blue in resin would it maintain its."	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=16506
4:35:13	"Color?"" That is a really interesting question And the likely answer of that."	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=16513
4:35:19	Is yes Now I would love there's an experiment I.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=16519
4:35:26	Would love to do with this stuff which is embedded in something like resin or.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=16526
4:35:33	Glass and then cuz one of the things is this stuff under goes infrared.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=16533
4:35:39	Luminescence shine a red light on it and it gives off infrared radiation.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=16539
4:35:48	So there's a there's a possibility that if this is embedded in a say a crystal or a epoxy.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=16548
4:35:55	Resin you could get enough transmission off of.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=16555
4:36:01	It that you could turn this into an infrared.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=16561
4:36:07	Laser But that's a scientific geek discussion for another night.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=16567
4:36:14	Okay So so with that said.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=16574
4:36:22	Um there's really nothing here that would give us a clue of how the uh.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=16582
4:36:27	Chairman were woven just from the colors alone But it's an interesting question and it's a good question Thank you very.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=16587
4:36:34	Much for asking the question Okay Uh do we have any non-s super chats we'll take one non-s super chat if we have one If.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=16594
4:36:41	We don't then we'll just call it a night Just one non-s super.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=16601
4:36:48	Chat mama Oh I'm very geeking right [Laughter].	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=16608
4:36:59	Now Bubble machine I was enjoying geek the geeking out Yeah it's pretty cool.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=16619
4:37:10	Okay if we if we've answered everything then we'll just call it a night then I'm kind of I'm cool with.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=16630
4:37:16	That I'm tired and it's after midnight So and we've given them lots to geek out.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=16636
4:37:22	On So Egyptian cut the stones with lasers.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=16642
4:37:29	Yeah Well don't think so but but hey you know these there's there's things.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=16649
4:37:34	That have special applications today Uh like oh what was it called methylene.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=16654
4:37:40	Blue Methylene Pew Pew A methyline blue is a.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=16660
4:37:46	Classic dye that was used in microscopy going all about 300 years.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=16666
4:37:53	It was invented like 300 years ago and it's been used as a dye But methylene.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=16673
4:37:59	Blue is laser reactive like like liquid lasers Okay Now what.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=16679
4:38:05	What a liquid laser is is you put the dye in a tube and it's a liquid but you.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=16685
4:38:12	Can stimulate that with radiation to create a laser from methylene blue and it's a laser that's.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=16692
4:38:20	Sometimes used in hospitals these days.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=16700
4:38:27	So but BC there's nothing to say they didn't use lasers Could be Could.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=16707
4:38:36	Be All right Mama says liquid lasers Yeah there were there are liquid.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=16716
4:38:42	Lasers There's gas lasers too Um there's a project in Scientific.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=16722
4:38:49	American where you could make a laser from automobile.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=16729
4:38:56	Exhaust Um kind of a dangerous experiment but it was an ultraviolet.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=16736
4:39:01	Laser You could make it using a gas tube out of automobile.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=16741
4:39:07	Exhaust All the oxygen's gone So it was carbon monoxide and.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=16747
4:39:13	Carbon dioxide would be so much fun Yeah so much fun to.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=16753
4:39:19	Play with in your living room Exactly Okay so we're going to call it a.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=16759
4:39:25	Night here.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=16765
4:39:31	BC how much to fun the laser making experiment i have not priced it out.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=16771
4:39:36	Okay All right that was fun All right Uh so we're going to call it a night here.	https://youtu.be/wf4G-NcyCe4?t=16776
