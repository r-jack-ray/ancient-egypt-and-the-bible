8:43	523	question per chat Uh no question stacking because there's just no way we can reasonably answer that So again
8:51	531	restrict your question to one question per chat Okay with that said let's get
8:57	537	into the questions Okay our first question of the
9:03	543	night is going to be coming from Joseph aptly named and he asks "Did
9:12	552	Egyptians actually think the brain was useless?" The answer to that is a surprisingly no They didn't think it was
9:19	559	useless They just weren't exactly sure what it did
9:25	565	Now why do we know this okay the reason why is because of surgical manuals Uh
9:31	571	and the particular surgical man manual is the Edwin Smith Papyrus So they did do surgery on the
9:39	579	brain to repair certain things from happening For example they knew enough
9:45	585	about say the function of the brain that they could do tonation which is a kind
9:52	592	of brain surgery where they open up a circle in the skull and remove part of the brain uh often a tumor So they they
10:00	600	understood that when the brain malfunctioned the rest of the person was not healthy Okay So they didn't think
10:07	607	the brain was useless At the same time too there wasn't a
10:12	612	practical way to extract the brain for say um
10:19	619	mummification So in that respect um they needed to
10:25	625	do when they when they mummified a body they couldn't take the brain out
10:30	630	So what ended up happening was usually that the brain was left in the skull and as the mummy dehydrated it just formed a
10:38	638	film inside the skull So
10:44	644	uh Gabe Reagan says "I don't know if I trust Bronze Age brain
10:50	650	surgery." Yeah but their patients survived uh we got lots of examples of of skulls
10:57	657	where they had performed tponation and it started
11:03	663	healing over you know there's evidence of the blood uh bone starting to knit back up so uh even though as as I said
11:12	672	very crude uh I and I wouldn't trust it myself but they it was an effective
11:21	681	treatment when it was targeting the right place
11:29	689	So Mama says "Wow I always thought that they did the hook through the nose
11:35	695	mashup thing." No And they that was a myth for a long time Uh many many people
11:41	701	still believe it today In fact many Egyptologists still believe it But um recent studies have shown that they
11:49	709	didn't go up the nose with a hook or anything like that what they did was they just left it there Um the problem
11:56	716	was that when 19th century um Europeans started cutting open
12:02	722	mummies they couldn't find a brain in it But that's they've they've now looked
12:07	727	using um using MRIs They can now see the film of the brain uh that aderes to the
12:14	734	side of the skull So yeah the whole the whole idea that
12:19	739	they went up the nose with a hook and drained out the brain is a myth Okay Um
12:25	745	but it's again this is this is these are recent findings These are recent findings that have shown that the that
12:30	750	they just didn't do anything with the
12:40	760	brain Um where's that okay I see that uh 811
12:47	767	Okay Michael Price did they know about the use of metal plates to counter infection naturally apparently they
12:53	773	didn't They didn't use metal plates uh which was not sure what they used but we
13:00	780	don't see any evidence of metal plates or any replacement for the skull So they
13:06	786	would cut it open and just I don't know if they they sewed it back over or what It's not clear exactly what sort of
13:14	794	post-operative treatment they did but they don't seem to have used metal plates
13:21	801	here Yeah Yeah Um it's possible they left it open It's possible they just sewed the skin in shut We don't know We
13:29	809	don't know exactly how they did it but they don't seem to have used a
13:35	815	metal plate Okay
13:43	823	uh nor wood There's no evidence that they used wood or
13:48	828	either uh in fact again uh the evidence seems to be that the that the bone
13:54	834	started to actually knit across the wound So if you have a metal plate there
13:59	839	that would interfere with with the knitting it So it doesn't appear to be any sort of of
14:05	845	um filler substance there So they just they just left it Again they might have
14:12	852	covered the sewn up the skin over it but once they sewed up the skin over it they sort of just left
14:20	860	it Okay So I think that covers the question So they did think that the that
14:27	867	the brain had a use They just didn't know what it
14:32	872	was Okay Okay the next question here is from Harry Stark and he asks a personal
14:39	879	question After David told his secular friends he was a Christian were there any of them surprised what are you a
14:46	886	Christian um no They're okay I never really told friends I was a
14:53	893	Christian Um it sort of just came up in casually in conversation So there wasn't any huge
15:01	901	like I'm a Christian guys No no no I didn't do that Okay And it's not
15:09	909	like I didn't talk religion with my secular friends Okay It was just just
15:15	915	sort of came up naturally So there there wasn't a there wasn't any
15:21	921	sort of shocking revelation there for them to
15:26	926	gasp you know you know you know you know we'd be
15:32	932	sitting around a a fire somewhere and you know yeah we we'd talk about you know uh do you believe in God yeah sure
15:40	940	Some of them said nah no not me It just it would just it would just be like that
15:45	945	where it would just just came up casually
15:51	951	So you know not everything has to be a a
15:57	957	um a dramatic monologue [Laughter]
16:07	967	moment This is like Yeah No no I mean too many people live their life with
16:12	972	drama anyway You know why does everything have to be a moment of drama of drama
16:23	983	okay you know if you don't present something with drama people are not going are less likely to respond with
16:29	989	drama Okay Just saying Just saying
16:39	999	Yeah Okay So uh yeah when my when my friends
16:45	1005	found out I was Christian it wasn't a surprise Um it just wasn't an issue
16:51	1011	though either So um hope that helps answer that
16:58	1018	question Now I will say one time it was a surprise Okay I will mention one
17:04	1024	person to whom it was a surprise Um there was a guy when I was working at Tap Pharmaceuticals whom I
17:11	1031	used to play chess with Okay And this guy was was one of those
17:19	1039	um say this He would be what we would call today a blue sky
17:25	1045	liberal Okay He was as as liberal as it came I mean far-left
17:33	1053	liberal and you know we we talked and uh you know eventually it turned to things
17:38	1058	like religion and stuff and you know he was I had managed to beat him four games
17:44	1064	out of five in chess and uh finally he asked me the question you
17:51	1071	know it's like you're you're smart and you're a Christian it's like
18:00	1080	[Laughter] Yes He's like "You're really
18:07	1087	smart." Yes I don't see how that could that's
18:12	1092	mutually exclusive to being Christian But hey he was surprised He was really
18:20	1100	surprised uh because he had such a low view of Christians that he think that he thought that no no Christian would be
18:28	1108	smart enough to beat him at chess let alone do that four out of five
18:39	1119	times Yeah he was surprised But hey
18:49	1129	That's the only person I I can think of that was really really shocked
18:56	1136	He was also stunned I beat him a chest too Yeah
19:03	1143	Okay So um yeah nobody's been surprised who's who's known me for any length of
19:09	1149	time Uh except for that one guy Okay Next question here comes from
19:17	1157	Mobius Uh and he asks "Considering how far back in time the history of Jericho
19:22	1162	goes isn't it odd that nothing from Abraham to Jacob mentions
19:27	1167	it?" Well that's actually not surprising Um Jericho was really a a
19:38	1178	a fortress that guarded the fords of the Jordan That was its purpose
19:45	1185	It was to prevent entry across the forts Okay And a fort is basically a low point
19:52	1192	in the river where you can cross on foot Okay Uh at Jericho there it it's it's
20:00	1200	right near those forts So it was Jericho was set up there
20:05	1205	to prevent people from coming in into Canaan
20:11	1211	Okay Through that entry port Okay Uh Abraham and Jacob didn't come through
20:18	1218	the fords of the of of the Jordan Okay they came north uh from the north
20:24	1224	through Syria At least Abraham did And Jacob was inside of Canaan
20:31	1231	already Um so neither Abraham nor Jacob ever had to
20:39	1239	cross the fords of the Jordan Okay because they never had to cross the fords of the Jordan There would have
20:45	1245	been no reason for them to have encountered Jericho So it was just not not near the
20:52	1252	anywhere where they were sort of sojurning You wouldn't take your flocks
20:57	1257	there I mean Jordan would be a horrible place to take flocks Uh so you know there's just no
21:04	1264	reason for them to go to Jericho
21:13	1273	So so you know it's it's not surprising that they didn't talk about I mean I
21:18	1278	mean Abraham sort of he was more around Hebron uh than than
21:23	1283	than Jericho So this is why they talk more about Hebrron
21:29	1289	too because they're going to be in areas both the patriarchs are going to be
21:35	1295	living in areas where your pasture flocks and Jericho is just not that place Okay so I hope that helps Thank
21:43	1303	you for the question Very much appreciate it Okay the next question here is
21:52	1312	uh from Mary Stark and this will be the last known super chat for the beginning segment here and he asks "Have book
21:59	1319	critics said anything about the novel?" Yes one book critic has Um there was a
22:06	1326	book critic on um Twitter who you know
22:12	1332	basically he he does he he does book uh reviews of um Christian
22:19	1339	fiction and he had um uh reviewed my book at the same time as he reviewed a
22:25	1345	book by um Shirley Johnson and John Delaros Okay
22:33	1353	And oh he had very high praise for it He had very high praise for it
22:38	1358	Uh yeah it's it is it is the one we posted in the community post Um yep
22:44	1364	that's the one Uh yeah I've been asked to read it Okay
22:50	1370	so um you can always go back and read this yourself but it is a very very funny review
22:57	1377	So uh he titles this reviews of novels that you as a Christian can enjoy and
23:02	1382	give your youngans That's fair enough He says I
23:08	1388	read Reloy of the Dead by Dr David A Faulk Overall a delightful novel Also
23:13	1393	one that gives me an excuse to talk about two potential pitfalls in pi in fiction writing
23:20	1400	The first is that specialists in any field other than fiction writing tend
23:25	1405	not to make very good fiction writers I agree with him totally here I've read some novels by
23:32	1412	um academic writers and they're awful normally Okay He says they tend to be
23:38	1418	didactic regarding their field of interest and not very convincing in terms of character and plot They also
23:45	1425	tend to be narrowly educated in their field with little experience or knowledge to inform other elements of
23:51	1431	their story resulting in glaring plot holes and technical
23:57	1437	mistakes Dr Faulk divi delightfully averts this
24:02	1442	trope demonstrating passible knowledge in a wide range of subjects need for a
24:08	1448	story which is a space exploration adventure with aliens Well part of the
24:13	1453	reason why I'm able to avoid this is I actually did fiction writing long before
24:19	1459	I did academic w So I've been writing fiction since my
24:26	1466	teens So and I didn't get into the um into doing academic work until my 30s So
24:33	1473	I've been writing fiction for decades prior to my ever getting into uh
24:39	1479	academia So that's one of the reasons why I was able to avoid that He continues "Color me surprised An
24:48	1488	outer space ancient aliens romp from an actual Egyptologist and it's actually
24:54	1494	good and fun and not bogged down by attempts to
24:59	1499	teach us all how much everyone else gets wrong about ancient Egypt." And I concur
25:04	1504	You know that wouldn't be fun In fact there's almost no ancient Egypt in it This is a good thing on Dr Folk's
25:12	1512	part especially for a Dave Bume novel It frees him to do what all
25:18	1518	fiction writers do write as non-PhDs based on research but with a focus on
25:23	1523	character plot and fun which is the point You know to introduce people to
25:29	1529	archaeology in a manner that's fun Okay
25:34	1534	He then goes on um which leads me to another phenomenon
25:41	1541	that tends to plague fiction writers Their sense of human psychology tends to be
25:47	1547	autobiographical The famous example of this is Lord of the Flies depicting the breakdown into savagery and tribalism of
25:53	1553	young boys on a resourcerich island Build as an insightful indictment
25:59	1559	of human nature It really ends up being an insightful window into the author's
26:05	1565	nature And meanwhile a group of actual school boys gets stranded on an island for
26:11	1571	months and has prayer every night and takes care of its members until dramafree
26:17	1577	rescue The human condition is widely varied and authors write what they know
26:23	1583	They write as if all people are the kind of people with whom they are familiar
26:29	1589	Apparently the kind of people Dr Faulk knows are
26:35	1595	a-holes Well
26:40	1600	um he goes "Our protagonist and every character he encounters are socially
26:45	1605	inept backstabbing children in adult bodies." Okay now not everyone I know is
26:53	1613	an a-hole okay but I did encounter an awful lot of them Especially when I
26:59	1619	worked in IT when I worked in corporate America it was much much it was just
27:06	1626	comical how many uh uh socially inept backstabbing
27:12	1632	children and adult bodies I encountered Then he asks "Is academia of
27:20	1640	ancient Egypt really so backbiting?" Um not so much Egyptology although there's
27:26	1646	some of that Uh theology Oh yeah Oh yeah
27:31	1651	In in theology and Christian seminaries oh yeah academia is that bite
27:37	1657	biting We must presume so And wonder if Dr Faulk needs a hug
27:43	1663	Yes I need a hug That said while the entire cast are
27:49	1669	steadfastly unlikable we yet manage to come to like the protagonist and his loyal assistant Gunhand and root for
27:56	1676	them The level of character development here is on par for commercial fiction but entertainingly
28:04	1684	idiosyncratic Dr Folk proposes that to resolve a politically sensitive and
28:10	1690	technically demanding crisis in a space colony on the verge of collapse you need a man with a particular set of skills
28:17	1697	And those are the skills of a socially inept Egyptologist And yet he just about pulls
28:24	1704	it off at least well enough to keep us entertained and intrigued by his particular twist on the ancient alien
28:31	1711	concept Lastly given the abrupt ending expect a
28:36	1716	series which is true The second book is already in pre-order Entertaining And it concludes
28:43	1723	here Entertaining thoughtprovoking educational minimal bad language and no lascivious content Fit for Christian
28:50	1730	audiences Enjoy
28:55	1735	Okay So that was one critic that who who reviewed my book and and it was a very
29:02	1742	positive uh review So yes
29:08	1748	uh we have had one critic review the book but only one so far But it was a very very positive
29:15	1755	review In fact all the all the reviews we've gotten so far have been extremely positive
29:25	1765	Uh Warrior of the Most High Wait a minute So this book is actually your take on ancient
29:30	1770	aliens yes sort of
29:37	1777	Yes And why not you know why not
29:42	1782	bc I'm not saying it was aliens but hey if you're going to do an ancient
29:49	1789	alien twist you know why why not i mean it's as as long as you you don't think it's real And I don't think I don't
29:56	1796	think the whole ancient alien thing is real but you know why not explore that
30:02	1802	as well what if it were real you know how could how would that play into man's
30:09	1809	explorations to the stars it could be very very
30:16	1816	interesting Okay So uh we have had as I said one uh critic review it and review
30:23	1823	it very positively So we're very thankful for
30:29	1829	that But here's the thing Um as long as you're able to separate fiction from
30:34	1834	reality yeah I don't mind I don't mind entertaining the possibility as a sort
30:39	1839	of a fictional well what
30:45	1845	if I think that's perfectly appropriate and perfectly okay But don't confuse it
30:52	1852	for
30:59	1859	reality Yeah Dossman says Stargate is a fun movie not a documentary
31:06	1866	Exactly Exactly It's not a documentary It's a fun movie
31:11	1871	though And I can I can appreciate movies that that that take that ancient aliens
31:16	1876	concept and play with it just on a matter of
31:22	1882	fiction but I would never say that aliens built the pyramids I mean I think that would that's
31:28	1888	stupid So it's like um but you know there are there are
31:34	1894	other ways you could play with the ancient alien concept and produce an intriguing kind of uh science fiction
31:41	1901	from it So and that's where we go with this this this series of novels Um are
31:47	1907	ancient aliens kind of more border on not only alien races but also
31:54	1914	spirit critters too Yeah we'll talk about more of this on Wednesday when we actually do the
32:01	1921	live stream on this Okay so let's get back to our questions here Our first super chat here is from
32:11	1931	uh Joseph for $2 Thank you for the super chat book recommendations for NT use of
32:17	1937	the Old Testament Unfortunately I don't have one
32:22	1942	Um there was supposed to be one that sounded really good at least in its premise that was
32:29	1949	supposed to be a cooperative effort between uh DA Carson and Treer
32:35	1955	Longman the third It for some reason just never went off I don't know what happened with that
32:42	1962	I had heard that there was an agreement between the two to produce a book that uh say went through
32:52	1972	um the New Testament and sort of ask the question um you know how does it how do
33:00	1980	these New Testament passages reference the Old Testament and for some bizarre reason
33:07	1987	the project never never went to fruition So I don't know if it was a fact that
33:13	1993	they couldn't get funding to complete it or what but
33:18	1998	um it just never happened It just never happened And that's I think it's really unfortunate cuz that could have been a
33:24	2004	really good resource but unfortunately um I don't know if it was turning out
33:31	2011	too long or somebody bowed out Um it could have been uh Longman who who bowed
33:37	2017	out of this because I heard he hasn't uh he had sort of um some sketchy health
33:42	2022	issues at that time So but I don't think there's anyone who's done a really really good job of
33:48	2028	this so far but there might be some some
33:54	2034	uh some other resources available out there that could help on this but I don't happen to know any off the top of my
34:00	2040	head Okay So thank you very much for the super
34:05	2045	chat but that's about the best I could do unfortunately It needs to happen though It needs to
34:12	2052	happen Okay Andrew Tinsley for $10 Thank you for the super
34:17	2057	chat What would have the Israelites have done during the 40 years in the desert
34:23	2063	mana would mean they didn't have to work much for food That's actually not true But
34:28	2068	uh would it be boring enough to be worse than slavery in Egypt uh okay They still
34:37	2077	had to work for food Um it's kind of a myth that um you know the mana just came
34:42	2082	and that's all they ate Um their diet did not just consist of of
34:50	2090	mana Now they did eat a lot of mana And there was an actually an I heard
34:57	2097	there was an interesting proposal um for what was uh mana
35:05	2105	um a micologist just recently talked about the desert truffle which is a kind of fungus that
35:11	2111	appears out on in savas Um and and I had thought when I
35:18	2118	when I read the the um the wandering in the desert in the mana that it it
35:24	2124	sounded a lot like fungus Anyway and the fact that somebody has identified a
35:30	2130	fungus that behaves like this I think is incredibly
35:36	2136	interesting Okay Now with that said
35:43	2143	um these people are not just sitting around collecting mana okay uh yes they
35:48	2148	are out there collecting mana and it's work okay it's work but they still have flocks to to to feed flocks to f to tend
35:58	2158	They have to go uh to drive their flocks to water and to silage They're still working okay
36:06	2166	they're not they're not sitting on their hands okay just because mana is feeding them doesn't mean they have they they
36:12	2172	they can just let the flock starve So they're still working They're
36:18	2178	still making tents They're still making still making clothes
36:24	2184	Yep They they have to still do the things of life Okay
36:31	2191	So so it might not be as interesting as living in Egypt but uh they still had a
36:39	2199	lot of work They kept busy Okay So
36:46	2206	um it's it's not a life of boredom It's it's a life of tedium And that's
36:52	2212	probably a better way of saying it
37:04	2224	Yep Um Dark Blade asks "Uh would there have been regular sacrifices during the wandering period?" There would have been
37:11	2231	some sacrifices um because you do have say uh the
37:16	2236	tabernacle So as long as the tabernacle was set up there'd be sacrifices So
37:29	2249	Um what do you make of the verse that says their gear didn't wear out i wouldn't take that as an absolute
37:36	2256	Okay It's more along the lines that God was kept supplying them in gear
37:44	2264	Okay So it was like it didn't wear out because there was always replacements
37:49	2269	Okay It's not that that they went out with one set of shoes and 40 years later
37:57	2277	entered the promised land with the same set of shoes Okay it's not like
38:02	2282	that It's more like that the Lord kept providing along the way Okay so they
38:09	2289	didn't suffer loss as they wandered out into the wilderness Okay
38:17	2297	so so I think I think that's a lot of it is it's it's it's an it's a naive
38:25	2305	reading to say that the that the that their clothes and their their shoes just didn't wear out at all Okay It's as I
38:33	2313	said it's more that the Lord provided along the way So it is like if as if it
38:39	2319	didn't wear out Okay
38:48	2328	U Mr Petups asks "Do you take the number of 40 years to be historical or
38:53	2333	allegorical?" I take it to be approximate Okay Um I think I think the
39:00	2340	when you start talking about 40 years um because it's an idiomatic number I think
39:05	2345	it gets really sort of dodgy whether or not it's an exact 40
39:12	2352	years Um but at the same time too from the historical records it does seem to
39:19	2359	be close to 40 years Whether it's 38 or 42 we're not sure but I wouldn't take it
39:26	2366	as an exact number Um I think it'd be a mistake to again overread an idiom as
39:34	2374	say an exact number So uh I wouldn't take this here
39:39	2379	as either allegorical or historical but I'd take it as idiomatic which means it
39:46	2386	it could be close but not necessarily exact
39:52	2392	All right I think that covers that question that super
39:57	2397	chat So overall um yeah they still worked They still worked It just was
40:03	2403	tending their flocks and basically building tents and that sort of
40:10	2410	thing Yeah it was it was very similar to the work they were doing in Egypt Less mud bricks though
40:21	2421	All right next super chat here uh from Andrew Tinsley for $5 Thank you for the super chat Do we know ancient any other
40:29	2429	ancient Egyptian king ancient Neareastern kings who had as many wives as
40:34	2434	Solomon yes we do Uh [Laughter]
40:40	2440	Ramse's Yeah Ramse's had that many wives
40:46	2446	Um here's the thing Uh Ramse's had or sorry Solomon had 700
40:52	2452	wives and 300 concubines
40:59	2459	Now here's the thing A concubine is technically not a wife but a slave that
41:08	2468	is there for pleasure purposes Okay
41:15	2475	So uh wives were generally done exchanged
41:21	2481	between kings for um daughters would be chain exchanged between kings to be
41:27	2487	treaty wives So most of these um wives would have been as a result of of
41:34	2494	cutting treaties and then the um concubines was kind of thrown in as bonuses Okay So
41:43	2503	there are gifts So
42:00	2520	no bad joke Mama says "So instead of practicing
42:06	2526	conspicuous consumption they were practicing conspicuous consummation."
42:12	2532	[Music]
42:19	2539	PC Honey I don't want to marry another wife It's for trade agreements I
42:25	2545	swear Well frankly uh there some of these kings had so many
42:33	2553	wives they never saw them Um and these these these women had to be
42:41	2561	housed clothed fed Um clothed clothed kept happy
42:49	2569	Um yeah some of them were well depends Uh some of them were miserable but yeah
42:56	2576	Well if you didn't keep them happy you also had her conspiracies and and that could be a
43:02	2582	threat to your life Um so uh yeah a lot of the a lot of
43:07	2587	women never saw the king never saw the king I mean there was there was some issues where say a especially concubines
43:16	2596	where a king had to do his duties uh to his regular wives never saw the
43:22	2602	concubines
43:29	2609	you sometimes he had a schedule but like for in the case of Solomon you know 700
43:34	2614	wives you know that's he got to see him once every two
43:48	2628	years Yeah Dossman says "Wow she's so pretty Wonder who she is She's your wife
43:54	2634	my king." Yeah that's a lot of times that's what it is That's not far from
43:59	2639	the truth you know say a guy like Ramse's who had
44:05	2645	not just treaty wives with kings across the Near East much more so than Solomon had but
44:12	2652	also had to take wives from say the regional
44:18	2658	governors of Egypt in order just to keep everyone happy Yeah he had tons and tons of wives
44:30	2670	Mysterious fungus says "So with Solomon the issue maybe wasn't the wives influencing specifically but each wife
44:37	2677	meant a new treaty with a pagan nation." Well there was that Yeah Yeah there was This is one of the reasons why um in the
44:46	2686	Penetuk um they're warned when you take a king
44:51	2691	do not allow him to acrue many wives gather much gold or breed many horses
45:00	2700	And there's a lot of issues why kings were not supposed to have lots of wives
45:07	2707	lots of gold and lots of
45:14	2714	horses Uh linguistmo conspiracy from the herum No one mentioned in Ramse's thei
45:20	2720	Yeah Yep Yeah Yeah he got he got that extra second smile because of um a conspiracy
45:29	2729	in the herum Yeah hers were dangerous places They are dangerous for women and
45:34	2734	they could be dangerous to the king
45:43	2743	too Yeah Yeah BC says "Got any mandates?" Yeah
45:51	2751	Hair in politics Yeah Yep
46:01	2761	Mysterious fungus That had the most
46:10	2770	Oh mysterious fungus I'd say Adam had the most wives He was married to 50% of the
46:16	2776	population Yikes Okay
46:22	2782	Yeah So yes there were kings in the ancient near east that had as many wives as Solomon Solomon had a lot of wives
46:30	2790	but he wasn't alone in that category Okay Um as I said Ramse's II had that
46:36	2796	many wives too So again not not unexpected for a great king Um
46:45	2805	minor kings never had that but say really really important kings did have that many wives
46:53	2813	Okay they just never got seen Okay the next one here next super
47:01	2821	chat is from off Oscar Fellow for uh $10 Romanian
47:11	2831	Thank you for the super chat He says "My sister has come back to Christ and is taking her children to
47:18	2838	church." Praise the Lord for that This has led to receive spiritual attacks and seeing shadowy figures Kids
47:26	2846	are scared Prayers are appreciated Any recommendations okay two
47:32	2852	recommendations One praise God Keep praising God Um demonic entities do not
47:39	2859	like praise Praise of God So if you praise God if you praise Christ and if
47:46	2866	these are really spirit entities they will be driven off Okay Now that's the
47:51	2871	first piece of advice Let's say that doesn't work though Okay If that doesn't
47:58	2878	work then you also have to look at the alternatives too which is that sometimes
48:06	2886	uh people seeing demonic figures is a result of a
48:12	2892	medical issue Okay and we can't overlook that Okay um we do know that some uh
48:20	2900	medications cause people to see shadowy figures We do know that uh sleep
48:25	2905	paralysis can cause people to see what is demonic entities Um there was even a
48:34	2914	case where a guy had suffered a kind of epilepsy
48:39	2919	Now in this particular kind of epilepsy he kept seeing demons
48:45	2925	everywhere he went and he was um he underwent
48:52	2932	um exorcisms and nothing worked Okay Um and they couldn't figure out what it was
48:59	2939	until he had an MRI and they discovered he was having these these microepileptic seizures that wasn't
49:05	2945	causing him to show physical seizures But it was causing him to hallucinate
49:12	2952	and see demons everywhere he went Okay Now that was ultimately treated with
49:18	2958	medication Okay So but everywhere he went he saw demons and they seemed
49:26	2966	real So um it his condition is very
49:33	2973	rare but it these things do happen So as I said again don't just do one medical
49:41	2981	or the spiritual here Do both If they if your if you and your
49:48	2988	kids your sister's your sister and her kids praise God with praise music prayer
49:55	2995	all that and goes away fantastic Problem solved If it doesn't go away look at
50:03	3003	those other alternatives too okay because you don't want to be scared about this Uh it doesn't do any good to
50:10	3010	be scared and if it's a medical uh condition it can be treated Okay so
50:16	3016	again that's what I would suggest here is you do both Do the praise see if that that
50:22	3022	works If it doesn't work yeah then look at the other issues say on the more uh
50:28	3028	psychological or the medical side of this All right so I hope that helps Thank you very much for the super chat
50:34	3034	very much
50:43	3043	appreciated PC Oreo if these entities can throw things around and open doors
50:48	3048	they can fold the laundry Absolutely Yeah What What's What's with
50:54	3054	these these entities throwing things off the shelves but they can't pick up a broom come on You messed it up Yeah you
51:01	3061	messed it up You cleaned it Um yeah I mean I I worked in a place once where
51:07	3067	things were flying off the shelves Yeah You think at any point that those those
51:13	3073	spirits would pick up a broom or put things neatly back on the shelf oh no No They just make a mess
51:21	3081	Yeah See start nagging them to clean up after themselves and they'll leave
51:40	3100	Yeah BC Scrub the darn toilet demon
51:55	3115	Yeah seriously though you don't want the kids scared you know
52:01	3121	Uh if it is demons messing with you uh they also are trying to drive you
52:07	3127	away from church um by by making you scared Um but
52:14	3134	they're also those are those are the cowardly demons too
52:22	3142	Oh yeah Yeah It should be counterinduct uh uh counterproductive because Yeah
52:28	3148	It's it's just telling people that yeah going to church is important that they're that they're so
52:36	3156	scared of you going to church that they're going to do whatever they can to keep you
52:42	3162	away BC demons are losers Yeah they're totally
52:47	3167	losers Okay so anyway that's uh that's that's
52:52	3172	the advice I'd give you on that Okay so I hope that helps
52:58	3178	Next one here from Oscar Fil for another 10 Romanian Thank you for the super
53:03	3183	chat If a person in the ancient near east felt the gods were angry at him and
53:09	3189	after much trying he could not please them on his own would he ask priests to
53:14	3194	intercede for him yeah often that happened Oh there was there was times when that happened where people in the
53:21	3201	ancient near east thought they had really um ticked off a a deity and
53:28	3208	couldn't appease it and and they did then they'd go to the priest and you know ask the priest to to do um
53:35	3215	offerings or sacrifices on their behalf So yeah that that did happen
53:41	3221	So and the priests were more than happy to do that because the priests knew that gods could be
53:51	3231	vindictive So so yeah this this is this was a thing
53:56	3236	this was a thing in the ancient near east
54:02	3242	Um you do see this I think a little more in say Mesopotamian records where you
54:08	3248	see this happening Uh then you do say in Egyptian stuff but it does it does occur in Egyptian stuff
54:17	3257	too Okay Dossman for $2 Thank you for the super chat Best explanation of the
54:24	3264	prosperity gospel Oh boy The best explanation is that you can
54:31	3271	have anything you want if you have enough faith to get it That's that's it in a nutshell
54:39	3279	It's basically if you have faith that you will get that MercedesBenz God is duty bound to give
54:47	3287	you that MercedesBenz Doesn't matter if it isn't
54:52	3292	good for you Doesn't matter if you didn't earn it
54:59	3299	Yeah Yeah Basically faith gives you money Exactly Warrior of the Most High
55:05	3305	Yeah If you're sick because you don't have enough faith If you're poor it's because you don't have enough faith Uh
55:12	3312	if you don't have um that MercedesBenz you know I mean not just I
55:19	3319	mean hey you know if if you have that Toyota Tursil from
55:25	3325	1982 you do not have enough faith because if you had enough faith you would have that Lamborghini you always
55:31	3331	wanted
55:37	3337	Uh Dossman asks "How did this start and how is it old?" It's not terribly
55:43	3343	old Um it sort of came out of an aberration of the Pentecostal
55:49	3349	movement So and it starts coming out in the
55:54	3354	1960s Okay so it's really not old This is not an old old movement at all
56:03	3363	Um it it kind of came out uh out of some of the revival teachings the Pentecostal
56:10	3370	revival teachings of the 1960s Um it really sort of got its um
56:17	3377	its sort of legs with tea evangelism Okay Tea evangelism really what sort of
56:27	3387	lit the fire to that gasoline Okay here's the thing Here's the thing
56:33	3393	um about tele evangelism Television is
56:39	3399	expensive If you want to stay on the air uh with a televised ministry you got to
56:45	3405	earn a lot of money Okay
56:50	3410	now if you have a let's just say a rather
56:56	3416	prosaic biblical theology you're not going to last long on TV You just can't earn enough money with
57:03	3423	a responsible biblical teaching on television So but prosperity gospels
57:13	3433	were uniquely um how do I say this uniquely suited for
57:22	3442	television They could leverage greed Okay they could leverage fear and
57:28	3448	greed to get people to part with their money And this is how guys like Kenneth
57:35	3455	Copeland uh Joel Olstein um
57:40	3460	um Benny Hinn you know Crelo Dollar you
57:46	3466	know these these guys who um basically spearheaded the Gabbit and Grabbit
57:53	3473	prosperity gospel crowd Yeah Yeah Joyce Meyer's another one Jimmy Swagger Yeah
57:58	3478	There's a lot There was a lot of them out there lot of them out there and they all gravitated to
58:06	3486	television
58:12	3492	Yeah Um as my producer here points out that if if if anything didn't come true
58:19	3499	it's because you didn't have enough faith in it So it was one of those those sort of
58:26	3506	um it's one of those sorts of theologies where it always reflects the blame back
58:31	3511	on the parishioner Hey you you you're sick Well
58:36	3516	you didn't have enough faith to give my ministry money It's your fault You don't
58:42	3522	have that car You didn't have enough faith to to to give me tens of thousands
58:48	3528	of dollars So it's your fault Yeah Dossman it's not my fault
58:55	3535	it's yours Yeah Micah Price It's your fault Believe harder Yeah that's pretty much it They
59:03	3543	not only Yeah they play on greed guilt and fear
59:08	3548	They really do
59:15	3555	Yeah Uh um as my producer said if someone in your family gets sick and dies they'll guilt you for not having enough faith Because if you had the
59:21	3561	faith they would have lived
59:27	3567	Yeah If you had had supported Kenneth Copelan's ministry your mother would
59:32	3572	still be alive Mama says "Spiritual abuse of the sheep." Oh totally It's totally
59:39	3579	spiritual abuse of the sheep Yeah Yeah Dustin says that is messed up
59:45	3585	It is really messed up It's so anti-biblical it's not even funny Yeah there's there's no support
59:53	3593	for it in the Bible at all Yet these guys are tearing the scriptures out of their context I mean there's been guys
59:59	3599	where you know they started preaching from a particular passage and it says exactly the opposite but they'll just
1:00:05	3605	sort of sort of do the two-step and say "You see this proves you need more
1:00:11	3611	faith." Yeah
1:00:16	3616	It's disgusting what they do It's disgusting Absolutely
1:00:23	3623	despicable So anyway that's my best explanation for the prosperity gospel
1:00:28	3628	The It's called Gabbit and Grabbit The um positive confession movement is
1:00:33	3633	another name for it So anyway I hope that helped Thank you very much for the
1:00:38	3638	super chat Very much appreciate
1:00:44	3644	Yeah So I hope that helps Thank you very much for the super
1:00:51	3651	chat Okay Joseph for $2 Uh thank you for the super chat Meaning of dominion of
1:00:57	3657	fish and birds in Genesis 128 Let's pull up our Bibles
1:01:05	3665	here Genesis 128
1:01:13	3673	Okay And this is talking about the creation of mankind here And it says in
1:01:19	3679	verse 28 "And God blessed him and said to them be fruitful and multiply and
1:01:24	3684	fill the earth and subdue it and rule over the fish of the sea over the birds
1:01:30	3690	of the sky and over every living thing that moves on the earth." All right
1:01:39	3699	Now this whole thing about ruling over the um uh having dominion over the birds
1:01:46	3706	and the fish essentially um the whole idea of of
1:01:52	3712	Genesis and say the created order is
1:01:58	3718	that the world was created this untamed wilderness Okay It was tamed untamed and
1:02:06	3726	wild Okay And God made man to have dominion
1:02:12	3732	or rulership over it Why to turn it into
1:02:17	3737	a garden essentially It seems that God's idea
1:02:24	3744	of perfect world order is like the
1:02:29	3749	garden of Eden a carefully tended garden Instead of say a wild wild planet
1:02:39	3759	God was intending man to basically show his dominion over it to make it more
1:02:46	3766	like Eden Okay so Eden is the template for the world
1:02:53	3773	Okay so Eden's the template Man's supposed to copy
1:02:59	3779	Eden He's supposed to take Eden and copy it everywhere Now what is Eden like
1:03:07	3787	we're not exactly sure but that's essentially what he's supposed to do Is
1:03:13	3793	he supposed to have show his dominion in the same way that God had dominion over
1:03:21	3801	Eden uh BC were supposed to be victorious over chaos Exactly Yeah
1:03:33	3813	Yeah Yeah Exactly And Grims goes "Which is not the view naturalists would hold
1:03:38	3818	to." Exactly Yeah They're saying "Yeah naturalists would hold that chaos
1:03:44	3824	is good." So but that doesn't seem to be God's plan for the world God's plan for
1:03:51	3831	the world is to bring order to the earth Order to the world to to Now now with
1:03:58	3838	that said it's not to exterminate life either Okay it's not to basically
1:04:06	3846	um how do I say this um destroy species Okay there is there is an aspect here of
1:04:13	3853	creation care where God gives creation to mankind and then mankind is supposed
1:04:20	3860	to to nurture and cultivate creation Okay
1:04:29	3869	So so I hope um you know that that that we we learn from that edenic
1:04:37	3877	experience But it is an edenic experience that is supposed to be
1:04:42	3882	nurtured and cultured into a semblance of of edenic
1:04:47	3887	order
1:04:53	3893	So so it's not naturalism but it's also not industrialism either
1:05:00	3900	It's sort of a a a happy um uh middle
1:05:06	3906	ground where man and nature are sort of
1:05:12	3912	uh man is caring for nature so that nature can propagate grow and be orderly
1:05:19	3919	within say um the Edenic context Okay
1:05:26	3926	though that's the meaning of dominion over the fish and birds in Genesis 1:28
1:05:32	3932	It is to to cultivate the order of creation So I hope that helps Thank you
1:05:39	3939	very much for the super chat Very much appreciate it Okay we're on to the AT ministries
1:05:47	3947	questions
1:05:53	3953	Woohoo All right Uh and we have a question here for 499 Thank you for the super

1:06:05	3965	blessings he has been given Okay let's go to Genesis
1:06:14	3974	38 8 to 9 Okay
1:06:24	3984	39 Sorry 39 Yeah Time for the AT show Yeah
1:06:31	3991	exactly We used to have a Bon Bon show Now we have an AT ministry
1:06:37	3997	show I know Bon Bon's hanging out here So
1:06:44	4004	okay Uh chapter 39 verse8 But he refused and
1:06:49	4009	said to his master's wife "Behold with uh with me here my master
1:06:56	4016	does not concern himself with anything of the house and he has put all that he owns in my charge There is no one
1:07:02	4022	greater in this house than I and he has withheld nothing from me except you Because you are his wife how then
1:07:11	4031	could I do this great evil and sin against God?"
1:07:16	4036	Okay He is talking about adultery here Okay Um and it's abuse of trust It's
1:07:24	4044	essentially an abuse of trust So there is both that going on here Um abuse of trust and uh uh
1:07:33	4053	basically adultery All right So he's basically saying to to
1:07:41	4061	Potterer's wife you know the master's been good to me He's put me in charge of
1:07:48	4068	everything Why would I abuse that trust you know by committing adultery
1:07:55	4075	okay so Joseph here is talking adultery but he's also talking about an
1:08:00	4080	abuse of trust And so while there was no say formal law on the books about adultery it was still
1:08:09	4089	thought as being wrong
1:08:14	4094	So So it does seem to be a it's not an abuse of the blessings it's an abuse of
1:08:19	4099	trust Uh there's also the Egyptian angle to
1:08:24	4104	this as well which is um crossing social
1:08:31	4111	strata from sort of the Egyptian sort of flip side of this The Egyptian view would have much
1:08:37	4117	more because Joseph's a slave
1:08:43	4123	Okay Um because Joseph is a slave the Egyptian side of this would see this as
1:08:52	4132	being a violation of the social strata Yeah So that would be very a very
1:09:00	4140	serious thing Um women in in Egypt committed adultery all the time Okay Usually that
1:09:08	4148	ended in divorce but when there was a violation of the social strata
1:09:14	4154	uh things penalties could get much more severe So uh there's that going on too that
1:09:22	4162	this is not only adultery and a violation of trust but it's also
1:09:29	4169	a a uh a shame offense because the wife of a high
1:09:37	4177	officer of the court is doing it with a slave And that's a violation of the
1:09:44	4184	social strata and Egyptian society looked very very poorly on
1:09:51	4191	that much more so than adultery in general So I hope that helped Thank you
1:09:58	4198	very much for the super chat Very much appreciate it Okay next one here from 18 ministries
1:10:06	4206	from 199 Thank you for the super chat Genesis 32:12 What garment would he have worn
1:10:13	4213	all right 32:12 And it says "They caught him by his
1:10:20	4220	garment saying "Lie with me." And he left his garment in her hand and fled and went out
1:10:28	4228	Okay Um sometimes Egyptians wore linen robes
1:10:35	4235	Okay Uh particularly important overseers would would wear these Okay and is is
1:10:41	4241	just more or less looks kind of like let's say this looks a little bit like a house
1:10:46	4246	coat but they're they're light linen Okay they're meant to be cool You just
1:10:51	4251	it's something you just wrap around yourself cuz it could get cold at night and it keep you uh warm at night cool in
1:10:59	4259	the day So that's what what they're talking about here is essentially a very light
1:11:07	4267	linen um robe essentially Okay So that's the garment
1:11:15	4275	she's talking about here So I hope that helps
1:11:21	4281	Um there is the possibility to it could have been his kilt All
1:11:28	4288	right that's a possibility too And in some ways that's the more likely
1:11:36	4296	possibility because every overseer would have wear worn a kilt Um a lot of
1:11:42	4302	Egyptians wore kilts So he might have fled
1:11:49	4309	naked Okay that's possible
1:11:55	4315	In which case if she shows his kilt to
1:12:01	4321	um to Potterer that's not a good look That's really not a good
1:12:08	4328	look because it means he got undressed Um
1:12:16	4336	yeah Din Egyptian streaking Yeah
1:12:25	4345	So I would say given given the context here given um I mean it doesn't say a
1:12:32	4352	robe here It says a garment So just a covering of some
1:12:39	4359	kind Okay So it's not this is not probably not a loin cloth It's probably a
1:12:45	4365	kilt But still um again a robe could be possible here
1:12:53	4373	But I think kilts is the more likely likely thing And all men of of status
1:12:59	4379	war wore kilts Even slaves who have had sla status war kilts See low low
1:13:08	4388	um low status slaves would wear um loin
1:13:13	4393	cloths but higher status um slaves would wear kilts
1:13:21	4401	So that's and they were knotted in the front by the
1:13:26	4406	way Yeah So parts didn't
1:13:33	4413	show I don't know This is not a sexual thing It's just hot
1:13:40	4420	Yeah Okay So that's probably what it's meant here by what garment he wore It's probably the
1:13:46	4426	kilt Okay Okay next one from AT
1:13:52	4432	[Laughter] Ministries Uh Dossman my new conspiracy
1:13:59	4439	Scottish Egyptians Well yeah they both wore kilts
1:14:06	4446	Uh Scots tended to wear a lot more than just the kilt though
1:14:13	4453	So 18 ministries for 199 How do you translate Malachi 21:16 what does
1:14:18	4458	Malachi 21:16 even
1:14:24	4464	say all right
1:14:30	4470	Malachi Malachi 2 16
1:14:40	4480	Oh for I hate divorce says the Lord the God of Israel and him who covers his garment with wrong says the
1:14:48	4488	Lord So take he your spirit that you may do not deal
1:14:54	4494	treacherously Let's look at the Hebrew
1:15:03	4503	here Okay Uh key I
1:15:23	4523	[Music] hate
1:15:28	4528	blocks is the Lord Uh Israel
1:15:37	4537	uh
1:15:50	4550	cover the Lord hosts that same verse
1:16:04	4564	I hate for I hate divorce says the Lord I would have to look up look this all up
1:16:09	4569	in alexagons to give you a decent um Yeah there's something hicky about
1:16:16	4576	this
1:16:23	4583	Um I hate shellock sending Okay it's using an
1:16:29	4589	idiom here It's using an idiom Uh for I hate sending away is what it says
1:16:39	4599	Um that's probably an idiom for divorce or I hate sending away and
1:16:48	4608	that's an idiom for divorce Um says the Lord um a God of
1:16:55	4615	Israel and the covering of
1:17:02	4622	violence Um the
1:17:09	4629	garment says the Lord of hosts
1:17:17	4637	and keeping on the wind
1:17:25	4645	spirit Okay
1:17:33	4653	Yeah Okay So in in verse 16 here it it uses an a euphemism here uh for I hate
1:17:41	4661	hate divorce And it's basically I hate the putting away And that's that's a euphemism for divorce says the Lord God
1:17:46	4666	of Israel and him who covers his garment with wrong says the Lord
1:17:54	4674	Um it's it's a very it's that that second passage is a that second um um
1:18:00	4680	subverse is a little strange Um so heed your spirit that you do not
1:18:08	4688	deal treacherously So I think I think that what's going on in this this particular
1:18:16	4696	passage seems to be that God is hating divorce But not only that but those who
1:18:23	4703	deal with in divorce
1:18:29	4709	treacherously So that seems to be what's going on here So
1:18:35	4715	um it is very poetic It's it's it's not an easy bit of
1:18:41	4721	Hebrew but um
1:18:46	4726	um Andagram is that alluding to no div marriage after divorce not
1:18:52	4732	necessarily U it does It seems to be alluding to sort of
1:18:59	4739	treachery within marriage like people who try to try to find excuses for divorce you know pretense uh a pretense
1:19:07	4747	for divorce So it's in that way like for example uh you marry a woman she ages
1:19:15	4755	you want to trade her in for a younger m uh model but uh you
1:19:22	4762	um don't have a good reason for divorce so you make one up I think it's more along those lines
1:19:29	4769	So those who deal treacherously as they try to seek
1:19:36	4776	out a divorce which God hates to begin with So you're taking an act that God
1:19:43	4783	disapproves of to begin with and then you add a guilty mind on top of it Yeah
1:19:50	4790	The Lord Lord's not going to like that So I think that's what what's being alluded to here Okay
1:19:59	4799	So I hope that helps A team um thank you very much for the super chat Very much appreciate
1:20:06	4806	it Okay at Ministries uh for one 99 Now he is talking about something I said on
1:20:12	4812	a previous live stream Benjamin Knights lived across the Jordan No they didn't This is what we call a mistake
1:20:19	4819	Okay this is where I said something that was incorrect Okay Um the Benjaminites
1:20:27	4827	did not live across the Jordan All right Yes Oh my gosh I know that's so shocking
1:20:32	4832	We do make mistakes some times on these live streams Okay It
1:20:39	4839	happens but we admit to our
1:20:45	4845	mistakes and bec Yeah Yeah It's It's when we look aren't
1:20:52	4852	sure of something we look it up and we come back Okay Or
1:21:00	4860	Yeah We don't double down on our mistakes That's bad And that's
1:21:07	4867	stupid Okay We aren't perfect We're not perfect
1:21:12	4872	Yeah We try to be we try to do these this thing right but there's times when we make mistakes Okay Now the tribes
1:21:20	4880	that did live on the far side of the Jordan are the tribe uh tribes of um
1:21:26	4886	Reuben Gad and Manasseh All right Uh mysterious funkus you're
1:21:34	4894	telling me you're aren't infallible i'm not infallible Hey look We we we answer
1:21:39	4899	these questions with no prep uh and basically what I happen to know
1:21:46	4906	off the top of my head plus what I can look up through the biblical text itself
1:21:51	4911	Okay so mama Oh look Folk is human Shocker
1:22:02	4922	Shocker Scott Waran Retractions such as this these is an example of why Dr Faulk
1:22:07	4927	is a reliable evidentialist Yes Yes If you get new information you
1:22:15	4935	should you should do a retraction Okay And this is a
1:22:21	4941	retraction Yes I said Benjamin Lights lived across the Jordan I was wrong They didn't It was um as I said it was the
1:22:29	4949	Reubenites the Gadites and um the tribe half tribe of Manasseh Now what I was
1:22:37	4957	making a reference to and uh at Ministries uh is referring
1:22:43	4963	to this in uh his next super chat Where are the Benjaminites in the New
1:22:49	4969	Testament it's not the Benjaminites it's the Gadites the tribe of Gad that's across the river Okay And where does
1:22:56	4976	that show up that shows up in Luke chapter 8 Okay
1:23:03	4983	So go to Luke chapter 8
1:23:10	4990	Okay And I think it's verse
1:23:17	4997	18 See it's here And
1:23:29	5009	minus Yes Okay
1:23:36	5016	All right And uh starting at verse 25 of Luke chapter 8 And Christ says to them
1:23:42	5022	"Where is your faith?" And they who are fearful and amazed and said to who is this then that he commands even the
1:23:48	5028	winds and the waters and they obeyed him So this is after the calming of the seas And they sailed to the country of the
1:23:55	5035	garrison which is opposite Galilee So this is on the far side of the Jordan
1:24:00	5040	um um near the um um the the city of
1:24:06	5046	Gasa which is in modern day Jordan and it's in the tribal holdings of
1:24:13	5053	Gad Okay and when he had come out in the land he was met by a certain man from
1:24:19	5059	the city who was possessed with demons and who had not put on clothing for a long time And he was not living in a
1:24:25	5065	house but in tombs And when seeing Jesus he cried out and fell before him before him and said "What do I have to do with
1:24:32	5072	you Jesus son of the most high i beg you do not torment me." For he had been commanding the
1:24:39	5079	unclean spirit to come out of the man for it had seized him many times and he was bound with chains and shackles and
1:24:46	5086	kept under guard And yet he would burst from his feathers and be driven by the demon in the desert And Jesus asked him
1:24:52	5092	"What is your name?" And he said "Leion for me many demons had entered
1:24:58	5098	him." And they were treating him not to command them to depart into the
1:25:03	5103	abyss And the abyss by the way is the jail for bad demons Okay not not there's
1:25:09	5109	any good demons but the bad of the bad This is your maximum security prison for demons here
1:25:16	5116	Okay verse 32 Now there was a herd of many swine Remember we are in the
1:25:21	5121	territory of the Gadites okay and there are swine feeding there
1:25:28	5128	on the mountain And the demons intreated him for permission to enter the swine And he gave him permission And the demons came out of the man entered the
1:25:34	5134	swine and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake And they were drowned
1:25:40	5140	And when the herdsmen these are supposed to be good Jews
1:25:45	5145	uh saw what had happened they ran away and reported this it in the city and out in the
1:25:52	5152	country Okay Um and verse 37 And the people of the
1:25:58	5158	country of the garrison again this is in the tribe of Gan Aad and the surrounding
1:26:04	5164	district asked him to depart from them And they were gripped with great fear And he got in the boat and
1:26:10	5170	returned Okay So there you have it Not the Benjaminites the Gadites It's in Luke
1:26:17	5177	chapter 8 And this is in the tribal holdings of the tribe of Gad
1:26:25	5185	So PC good juice keeping them piggies Yep
1:26:33	5193	Yep How far they've fallen Yeah Now um again it's not um you
1:26:45	5205	could as a Jew you could keep animals that were richly unclean to eat Okay
1:26:54	5214	that was something you could do There were things that were richly unclean to eat But then there was this special
1:27:01	5221	class of animal that were just not just unclean to eat but unclean to
1:27:06	5226	touch Okay and pigs are one of those those particular animals that were not
1:27:12	5232	just unclean to eat but unclean to touch So what were Gadites
1:27:19	5239	doing with pig i don't know Doesn't seem very um Jewish to me
1:27:27	5247	Just saying But there were animals as I said in previous live streams that that were
1:27:34	5254	unclean to te to to to eat but clean to touch Horses donkeys camels Unclean to
1:27:43	5263	eat Clean to touch Pigs aren't among
1:27:49	5269	them Serious fungus Maybe they liked watching them Uh I don't think that was it Just
1:27:57	5277	saying Just saying Okay
1:28:05	5285	So there's the correction and there's the where the Gadites appear in the New
1:28:11	5291	Testament So I hope that helps Sorry about the uh mistake Thank you very much
1:28:16	5296	for the super chat Very much appreciated BC is pig leather a thing
1:28:22	5302	yes it is It is a thing Uh it is definitely a thing It has been used
1:28:28	5308	throughout history Um not something that a
1:28:36	5316	um a good Israelite should touch Okay Again pig is unclean to touch and pig
1:28:42	5322	leather is also unclean Now that said
1:28:49	5329	um footballs even though they're called pig skins are not made of pig leather They're made of cow leather So footballs
1:28:56	5336	are not richly unclean
1:29:04	5344	Okay Next one here from 18 ministers for 199 Thank you for the super chat Did
1:29:11	5351	Nefertiti take Nefra Nefu Aan as a throne name
1:29:18	5358	um that's a controversial subject Now I think most people most of
1:29:26	5366	the it's I'd say the majority of Egyptologists now think that Nephroatin
1:29:33	5373	was not Nefertiti but Nefertiti's daughter
1:29:38	5378	Okay But she had several she had I think something like four
1:29:44	5384	daughters Okay She had four daughters Nefertiti had four daughters
1:29:51	5391	Okay And it does seem that one or two of them were placed on the
1:29:59	5399	throne So the majority of Egyptologists seem to now lean towards the idea that
1:30:05	5405	Nephrodu at was one of these daughters of Nefertiti that she placed on the throne
1:30:13	5413	that she used her influence as um with the royal court to put this per uh put
1:30:22	5422	up one of her daughters on the throne at Amarna Okay that didn't last long
1:30:29	5429	Um we don't don't know the exact circumstances but that does not seem to have it seems to have lasted for less
1:30:35	5435	than a year maybe a year tops that that these daughters of
1:30:42	5442	Nefertiti ruled Uh cuz it seems that Tudin Common was
1:30:48	5448	backed by the military to to put an uh the the last Thean prince on the
1:30:56	5456	throne cuz daughters taking the throne were
1:31:01	5461	um had a much much weaker claim than
1:31:07	5467	a than a male heir So so it looks like and Nefertiti did
1:31:16	5476	not have a claim to the throne She did not have a claim to the throne Um not in any meaningful
1:31:22	5482	way but her daughters had a weak claim to the throne Her daughters had a bigger claim
1:31:28	5488	to the throne than she did So it sounds like that Nefertiti put her
1:31:35	5495	daughters on the throne um and and basically had basically a
1:31:41	5501	puppet government So so she would be ruling through her
1:31:50	5510	daughters which is generally what the majority think at this point as far as Nefroen is concerned Okay so I hope that
1:31:58	5518	helps Thank you for the super chat very much
1:32:04	5524	appreciated 18 Ministry for 199 Thank you for the super chat Thoughts on the Dynasty 5 tomb discovery
1:32:12	5532	um I I don't know much about it yet Um I'm still waiting for official
1:32:18	5538	publications on this Um there's there's lots of Old Kingdom tombs that come out
1:32:23	5543	now and again Uh I'd have to wait and see I I'd like to see what the
1:32:29	5549	inscriptions are and what if there's any like regal years or anything like that
1:32:35	5555	So I'd like to get an actual publication of it before I comment on it Um I've
1:32:41	5561	only seen the news a brief news presser on this It didn't tell me much So um I
1:32:49	5569	don't have any any real opinion on it yet So thank you very much for the super chat Very much appreciated
1:32:59	5579	80 ministries for $4.99 Thank you for the super chat Is it just me or are skeptics becoming more skeptical without
1:33:06	5586	warrant just cuz I I don't think that's wrong No I don't think that's wrong Um
1:33:12	5592	and I think it's a it's a trajectory of of say atheism losing its steam
1:33:22	5602	Now when I was young yeah it it shocks people to when they find out I was once
1:33:28	5608	[Laughter] young Um atheism is just something that people held Okay you know it wasn't it
1:33:36	5616	wasn't it wasn't a say a more ideological thing until you started getting guys like um Sam Harris um
1:33:47	5627	um Doc uh Richard Dawkins you know the new atheists okay the new atheists
1:33:55	5635	um the new atheists made this very ideological
1:34:01	5641	okay but now that sort of new atheist ism has lost its lost its gas Um it's
1:34:09	5649	it's lost its steam It's sort of um sort of falling out of favor now
1:34:16	5656	uh you're getting into a period where sort of atheism has gotten into
1:34:24	5664	um what we would call say a partisan phase uh a doctrinire phase an ideological
1:34:30	5670	phase where it's warrant doesn't matter once
1:34:35	5675	you start getting into partisanship and and ideology and
1:34:41	5681	doctrinary kind of positions yeah all of that all of that just um sort of you
1:34:46	5686	don't need warrant anymore So
1:34:53	5693	um so yeah that's um that's just I think I think that's
1:34:58	5698	just the sign of of of atheism sort of losing its losing its
1:35:05	5705	momentum And this often happens you know with with various positions various
1:35:11	5711	positions that have difficulty defending themselves and then resorting to
1:35:18	5718	um just nuh-uh
1:35:23	5723	arguments you know it's not it's not a reasonable debate anymore So uh you just this is just what happens
1:35:32	5732	when you when when sort of movements like this run their course
1:35:41	5741	So so I hope that helps Thank you very much for the super chat Very much appreciate

1:40:04	6004	Absolutely
1:40:15	6015	Yep Okay Okay Let's get back to the super chats here
1:40:21	6021	Uh next super chat is from AT Ministries for $4.99 Thank you for the super chat
1:40:26	6026	What double offense did Moses do to not enter Canaan uh doesn't necessarily need
1:40:32	6032	to be a double offense It just needs to be a serious offense Okay
1:40:39	6039	Um was Miriam's complaining and being in the tent a double offense now that was a
1:40:44	6044	double offense Okay Um in in the case of Miriam uh she had not only questioned um
1:40:52	6052	God's word she had also entered into the tent of meeting okay which yeah there there
1:40:59	6059	was a double offense there so in the case of Miriam there was a double offense in Moses what caused him to not
1:41:08	6068	enter Canaan was the fact that he had misrepresented what God said by acting
1:41:15	6075	angry towards the Israelites when he struck the stone for water
1:41:21	6081	Okay so in that particular case it was a single offense But what Moses had done was
1:41:28	6088	shown the Israelites that God was angry when God wasn't
1:41:34	6094	angry So that was Moses's anger being taken out on the Israelites
1:41:43	6103	And it's it's uh basically a violation of the
1:41:48	6108	um of the um um
1:41:53	6113	oh of the commandment um which one was it
1:41:58	6118	now um taking the Lord thy God's name in
1:42:04	6124	vain Okay It's it's it's it's the taking uh the God's name in vain because what
1:42:10	6130	the that that commandment is actually about is being a poor
1:42:18	6138	representative of of somebody who takes on the name of God Okay
1:42:28	6148	So yeah like all of Gab and Grabbits you know people who claim to be ministers of God and basically aren't representing
1:42:34	6154	him at all Okay So so that's what Moses was guilty on was misrepresenting God to
1:42:43	6163	the Israelites So that was a serious enough offense that it didn't take a double
1:42:49	6169	offense That was just serious enough on its own
1:42:56	6176	Uh but in the case of Miriam there was a double offense there You know she was
1:43:01	6181	she had um questioned God's word and she had also um was not supposed to be in
1:43:10	6190	the tent of the meeting Okay so that's what's going on there So I hope that helps Thank you for the super chat Very
1:43:17	6197	much appreciate it at Ministries for 199 Thank you for the
1:43:23	6203	super chat What makes Abraham a prophet ooh
1:43:30	6210	Yeah Uh
1:43:35	6215	um Mama says he disobeyed God and bore false witness against him in a way at
1:43:42	6222	the same time Yeah Um it is one offense but it does sort of
1:43:48	6228	violate two things So I'm not sure if it's if that would be still constitute as a double offense or
1:43:57	6237	one offense that just did two things but he did But you're absolutely
1:44:02	6242	right mama He did disobey God but he also bear false witness against him But
1:44:09	6249	again that that comes down to that would collapse into the um into the um
1:44:16	6256	uh say the taking the Lord thy God's name in vain
1:44:25	6265	So okay so what makes Abraham a prophet what makes Abraham a prophet is that he
1:44:32	6272	received a theophony So he was visited by
1:44:38	6278	um by the angel of the Lord and the angel of the Lord gave him two
1:44:45	6285	prophecies Okay Um one that he should bear a son
1:44:51	6291	and that he should be a father of many nations So that's the first one
1:44:57	6297	The second prophecy he was given is that the um that the Israelites will be in um
1:45:07	6307	in um Egypt for 400 years Okay
1:45:16	6316	So that's what makes him a prophet is he was given prophecies
1:45:22	6322	Okay So I hope that helps Thank you very much for the super chat very much
1:45:30	6330	appreciated 18 ministries for 199 Thank you for the super chat I don't like wine
1:45:36	6336	What do I do for communion well uh depends on your
1:45:44	6344	denomination Okay Some denominations insist on wine
1:45:49	6349	and you cannot get around that with that Okay
1:45:56	6356	So uh if you're in one of those denominations that insists that communions has to have wine
1:46:03	6363	um then you're kind of stuck with wine But there's also depends upon the
1:46:12	6372	denomination Um some denominations like
1:46:19	6379	um uh some denominations will also allow you to use water
1:46:25	6385	Okay Uh yeah most most denominations will make exceptions for
1:46:34	6394	alcoholics Um some denominations
1:46:40	6400	um use grape juice like most evangelical denominations will use grape juice not
1:46:45	6405	wine I think Lutheran insist on wine Okay Lutheran insist on wine uh orthodox
1:46:53	6413	you could use either wine or holy water So again it's all this is going to
1:46:59	6419	depend upon um do Hey hun um let me ask you a
1:47:05	6425	question on Catholics Do Catholics is the priest only drink the wine or does the parishioners drink the wine
1:47:12	6432	too you okay yeah Okay
1:47:18	6438	So so this is a largely going to depend on your denomination
1:47:24	6444	essentially Um so a lot of it is is going to depend upon the denomination Um but it again um
1:47:32	6452	most have most will have an alternative to wine So I hope that helps Thank you
1:47:38	6458	for the super chat Very much appreciate it
1:47:46	6466	Okay 18 ministries for 199 Explain Daniel 11:37 Oh
1:47:55	6475	boy In 2 minutes or less Yeah good luck with that
1:48:01	6481	Um all right Let's let's talk a little bit about Daniel 11 okay because this
1:48:06	6486	one this one is this is an ugly passage All right Um this is an ugly passage
1:48:14	6494	because it's prophecy It's not clear prophecy Um I know there are people who
1:48:20	6500	have um suggested this is the tools and the solucides going after at each other
1:48:28	6508	But there also seems to be some intimation of that this also involves the abomination that makes desolate Okay
1:48:37	6517	before he gets into or after he gets into that Now the particular passage here is
1:48:43	6523	30 uh or sorry verses 37 Okay Now um it's talking about here a
1:48:52	6532	back and forth between the king of the north and the king of the south Again we don't know exactly who the king of the
1:48:58	6538	north and who the king of the south is Some people have have suggested that the king of the north is the solucids King
1:49:04	6544	of the south is the tools Okay but we're not sure
1:49:12	6552	Okay but then we get this this passage in verse
1:49:17	6557	37 and it talks about a king of the north and who that
1:49:25	6565	is It starts here in verse 36 Then the king will do as he pleases and he will
1:49:33	6573	exalt and magnify himself above every god and will speak monstrous things
1:49:40	6580	against the God of gods And he will prosper until the indignation is
1:49:47	6587	finished For that which is decreed will be done Verse 37 And he will show no
1:49:53	6593	regard to the gods of his fathers or for the desire of women Nor will he show
1:49:59	6599	regard for any other god For he will magnify himself above them all But
1:50:06	6606	instead he will honor a god of fortresses a god whom his fathers did not know He will honor him with gold
1:50:14	6614	silver costly stones and treasures and he will take action against the strongest of forces with the help of a
1:50:20	6620	foreign god He will give great honor to those who acknowledge him and he will cause them to rule over many and will
1:50:27	6627	parcel out the land for a price Verse 40 And at the end of
1:50:34	6634	time at the end time the king of the south will collide with him And the king
1:50:39	6639	of the north will storm against him with chariots and with horsemen and with many ships And he will enter countries
1:50:45	6645	overthrow them and pass through He will also enter the beautiful
1:50:52	6652	land and many countries will fall but these will be rescued out of his hand
1:50:57	6657	Edom Moab and the foremost of the sons of Ammon He will stretch out his hand against other countries and the land of
1:51:04	6664	Egypt will not escape All right So what we're talking
1:51:10	6670	here is looks like um yeah um it does it on the surface it
1:51:17	6677	appears like Antiochus the fourth epiphanies uh but it's it's more than that It's
1:51:23	6683	more than that Um Antiochus It could be that this is this is representing Antiochus but
1:51:31	6691	Antiochus was just a type of antichrist Uh he was the
1:51:36	6696	archetype Okay But he's not the anti-ype
1:51:42	6702	So there does seem to be that um it's it's a a loose
1:51:50	6710	um a loose illusion to Antiochus IV but it does seem to be that there's that
1:51:58	6718	that this is esqueological as well as in verse 40 it says at the end
1:52:05	6725	time Okay if this was during the time of of
1:52:12	6732	Antiochus this is not the end time Antiochus is the beginning of that
1:52:19	6739	topology So it's the beginning of the Antichrist
1:52:28	6748	trajectory So you wouldn't expect that that that phrasing at the end time to be
1:52:37	6757	to be applicable to Antiochus because Antiochus IV is an
1:52:44	6764	antichrist He's the archetype of the antichrist but he's not the the the
1:52:49	6769	fulfillment of that trajectory So getting back to that
1:52:55	6775	particular verse uh 11:37
1:53:01	6781	So whoever this figure is he will show no regard to the gods of
1:53:06	6786	his father Okay so he's not a religious man Okay he's not a religious
1:53:12	6792	man He basically is thumbming his nose at the gods of his
1:53:19	6799	fathers or for the desire of women Okay so he's he he doesn't care
1:53:27	6807	about bodily pleasure at least not from women It's
1:53:32	6812	not what it's it's not what motivates him He's not motivated by religion of
1:53:39	6819	his of his ancestors He's not motivated by by say um sexual
1:53:48	6828	pleasure at least not from women Um and he will not show regard for
1:53:55	6835	any other god And and what this is doing is it's
1:54:01	6841	giving you the mindset of this antitype of the
1:54:06	6846	antichrist okay of of the abomination that makes desolate So he's basically saying that
1:54:13	6853	this is this is a guy of of of focus He is incredibly focused
1:54:20	6860	He's not focused on he's he's not distracted by religion He's not distracted by by women He doesn't he
1:54:26	6866	doesn't regard any other deity Uh and it says at the end of verse 37 "For he will
1:54:33	6873	magnify himself above all of them." Mama says "Sounds like a
1:54:39	6879	narcissist." Realistically he probably is a narcissist Yeah it's it's obvious he's a narcissist
1:54:47	6887	mama Everything is about him Yeah Yeah But he's also a guy who who's
1:54:53	6893	not given to that sort of he's not a guy
1:54:58	6898	who's easily swayed Okay Um but 38 it says "But instead he
1:55:05	6905	will honor a god of fortresses." That's a really interesting phrase A god of
1:55:11	6911	fortresses Military might is his
1:55:18	6918	god Military might is his god A god whom his fathers did not
1:55:25	6925	know And he will honor him with co gold costly silver and treasures So
1:55:30	6930	essentially he's going to pour all his money into his
1:55:36	6936	armies Verse 39 and he will take action against the strongest of fortresses with
1:55:42	6942	the help of a foreign god And we don't know who that is He's not he's not lauding that foreign god but he's being
1:55:49	6949	helped by a foreign god And he will give great honor to those who acknowledge him and will cause
1:55:58	6958	uh them to rule over many and parcel of out the land for a price Okay Yeah Big
1:56:03	6963	old war chest Exactly mama Big old war chest Yeah What's his what is his his his his
1:56:13	6973	god tanks and soldiers and bombs and
1:56:19	6979	missiles That's his god Military
1:56:27	6987	power That's what he worships is military power
1:56:34	6994	you know F-35s you know that sort of thing is what he's going
1:56:40	7000	to to to worship You know aircraft carriers Yeah
1:56:47	7007	Nukes Yeah Nukes Yeah That's the sort of that's his
1:56:54	7014	god his military power and that's what he
1:57:03	7023	exercises So yeah you know his Andrew Graham's not
1:57:09	7029	Donald Trump either Yeah I don't think
1:57:14	7034	so Gain of function boweapons Well possibly That's that's another possibility too But really this is a guy
1:57:21	7041	of of military means That's what he is into You know religion means nothing to
1:57:28	7048	him because it says here in verse 36 he'll say monstrous things against the
1:57:33	7053	God of gods and magnify himself above every god It's all about power
1:57:49	7069	So bubble machine What happens when weapons fail well that's why he's got
1:57:54	7074	lots of them That's why he's got lots of them you know Yeah Ultimately weapons
1:58:02	7082	will fail But a guy like this just accumulates more He's a This
1:58:09	7089	is a This is This is a person who's accumulated so much weaponry that this is what he's
1:58:15	7095	worshiping
1:58:27	7107	Yeah Scott Warren kind of sounds like Putin generally speaking Yeah Putin's
1:58:32	7112	kind of a second rate version of this really
1:58:39	7119	you know Okay So that's that's the explanation for Daniel
1:58:45	7125	11:37 is this is a guy um again it's probably talking about the antitype of
1:58:52	7132	the of the um abomination that makes desolate
1:58:57	7137	trajectory It's couched in that solucid tom struggle but it's saying this is
1:59:03	7143	beyond that struggle And there's always been that a sort of
1:59:08	7148	struggle like this in the ancient near east Okay So this is not specific to say the tom and seucids but
1:59:17	7157	there's always been struggles like this whether it been between the matani and the Egyptians or say the Hittites and
1:59:24	7164	the Egyptians You know this sort of king of the north versus king of the south thing has been going on for since the
1:59:30	7170	bronze age So it's not a new conflict This this this but this seems to be the general
1:59:38	7178	millu of superpowers fighting their little wars in the
1:59:44	7184	Levant And this is just the consummation of those wars and this is the final figure that
1:59:52	7192	sort of comes out of those wars So hope that helps Thank you very
1:59:58	7198	much for the super chat Very much appreciate it
2:00:03	7203	Okay 18 ministers for 199 Thank you for the super chat Explain Deuteronomy
2:00:10	7210	14:24-27
2:00:18	7218	Okay Deuteronomy
2:00:25	7225	14 24 Okay Uh oh it's this passage Okay
2:00:30	7230	And the passage reads "And if the distance," this is talking about the bringing of the tithe If the distance is
2:00:37	7237	so great that you are not able to bring the tithe since the place where the Lord your God chooses to set his name is too
2:00:44	7244	far away for from you when the Lord your God blesses you then you shall exchange
2:00:50	7250	it for money Bind the money to your hand Go to the place which the Lord your God
2:00:55	7255	chooses And you may spend the money on or whatever you your heart desires for
2:01:02	7262	oxen or sheep or wine or strong drink or whatever your heart desires There you
2:01:08	7268	shall eat it in the presence of the Lord your God and rejoice you and your household Also do not neglect the Levite
2:01:15	7275	who is in your town for he has no portion of or inheritance among you
2:01:21	7281	Okay here's what's going on here in Deuteronomy 14 This is a really interesting passage
2:01:28	7288	and I wish I wish I I've never heard a sermon on this passage I've I've I've known about this passage and I've even
2:01:34	7294	talked about it on this channel once or twice but here's what's going on Let's say you live in a place that's
2:01:41	7301	too far away to bring your tithe Okay um now
2:01:49	7309	today there's churches usually very close by to wherever you live but that wasn't always the
2:01:55	7315	case But let's say for example you live in Antarctica You're a scientific team in Antarctica You're still getting paid
2:02:03	7323	but you're too far away to bring your tithe What do you
2:02:09	7329	do well assuming you're you're not don't have a home church and you can't just autot using your uh PayPal
2:02:18	7338	account what you do here is you can take
2:02:23	7343	the tithe money and you can spend it however you
2:02:30	7350	wish Uh and and and basically it's it's saying that okay you can't bring it to
2:02:36	7356	the temple or the tabernacle but you might have a local
2:02:44	7364	Levite and you go and you take your tithe exchange it for money and then you
2:02:50	7370	buy what you want with it Sheep oxen
2:02:56	7376	wine pooch Yes strong
2:03:03	7383	drink It's right here Um for those of you uh of of you
2:03:09	7389	who think that uh uh God thinks um alcohol is a sin here's God telling
2:03:17	7397	people that if you can't bring your tithe you can spend this on on on
2:03:23	7403	firewater Okay and then consume
2:03:33	7413	it Oh yeah I'm going to get so backlash for that So yes you can you can spend it on
2:03:40	7420	on whiskey
2:03:47	7427	Okay So you can you can spend on whatever you decide and there you shall eat it in the presence of the Lord your
2:03:53	7433	God and rejoice you and your household But it also says do not
2:03:59	7439	neglect the Levite Okay so because you're not bringing your tithe to the temple that the Levite's not getting his
2:04:06	7446	share so do share it with the Levite too So
2:04:13	7453	um share your your your your whiskey with the [Laughter]
2:04:20	7460	Levite Glenn Vidic Yep Glad
2:04:28	7468	Vidic Dossman Dr Faulk promotes alcoholism I didn't say that Did not say
2:04:34	7474	that No he doesn't Share your Not drink it all yourself Not
2:04:40	7480	drink it all yourself Share
2:04:47	7487	Danny Dement Reverend Pastor Dave told me
2:04:58	7498	so Andrew uh Graham as long as your household is over 21 laugh out loud That
2:05:03	7503	only depends upon which state you live in by the way Uh and which country Um
2:05:09	7509	there are countries and states where minor consumption of alcohol is
2:05:14	7514	permitted in the presence of a parent Okay
2:05:20	7520	so that depends on your state but follow the local laws
2:05:31	7531	Okay Yeah Don't drink and drive That's that's not a good thing
2:05:41	7541	Yeah So um it is actually saying here that you can spend
2:05:46	7546	uh your tithe if if you're too far away from a from from a place where you can
2:05:52	7552	bring your tithe you can spend it on essentially a
2:05:58	7558	party A party oxen sheep wine pasta strong drink
2:06:09	7569	Yeah Yeah You're having a party and you're also feeding others in the process
2:06:15	7575	So yeah Uh Slam RN says uh have a party Yes Exactly what it is Yeah Have a party

2:07:48	7668	uh 14:24-27 Thank you very much the super chat Very much appreciate
2:07:53	7673	it Okay 18 ministries for $4.99 Thank you for the super chat What does it mean
2:07:59	7679	to be a priest of the order of MelkiseDC because of his indestructible life hebrews 7:15-17 All right let's go to
2:08:06	7686	the passage Read the passage and let's execute the passage
2:08:12	7692	Hebrews chapter 7 verse 15 17
2:08:22	7702	All right And the author of Hebrews in verse 15 says "And this is clear still
2:08:28	7708	if another priest arises according to the likeness of Melkisedc who has become such not on the
2:08:36	7716	basis of a law of physical requirement but according to the power of an
2:08:42	7722	indestructible life For it is witnessed of him thou art a priest
2:08:49	7729	forever according to the order of MelkiseDC All
2:08:55	7735	right Now the context of Hebrews
2:09:01	7741	7 is that Hebrews has two themes There's two
2:09:08	7748	themes in the book of Hebrews Okay one theme is that
2:09:15	7755	um to warn you against apostasy The second theme is that Christ
2:09:21	7761	is greater than anything He's greater than the law He's greater than the
2:09:27	7767	prophets He's greater he's greater than the unfulfilled promises and he's greater than the
2:09:35	7775	priests Why is he greater than the priest and this is what Hebrews 7 sort
2:09:41	7781	of lays out Okay why Christ is better than the
2:09:47	7787	priesthood Okay and it comes down to that he is a priest in the order as
2:09:53	7793	accord according to the order of Melkazedc Now what does that mean now
2:10:01	7801	specifically MelkiseDC is was the ruler of of Salem
2:10:08	7808	uh Uru Salem which was a Jebusite city It was a
2:10:13	7813	city of Jebusites Um it was the old Jerusalem before it became Jerusalem Okay It was
2:10:22	7822	um as I said it was a Jebusite city It was a pagan city It worshiped um the god
2:10:30	7830	Shalam which was a um a um ideological god a god of peace Okay
2:10:39	7839	Um Zadok um melkisedc comes from the name um u
2:10:46	7846	melki zedok um Zado is king and zadok was another Jebisite god Zadok is the
2:10:54	7854	god of righteousness So these are the sort of categories that um um Jebiside gods took on So a a
2:11:03	7863	Jebiside god would be say a god of peace a god of of of righteousness They'd also
2:11:08	7868	have probably gods of war as well and that sort of categories
2:11:13	7873	So So that's how the Jebusites did their their religion It was it was an ideological
2:11:20	7880	um kind of of god okay set of gods Okay
2:11:26	7886	Now MelkiseDC in the in in the text is honored as a priest by
2:11:32	7892	Abraham MelkiseDC is a king and a priest which
2:11:38	7898	is something that's not a Levitical priest He is not a priest according to
2:11:43	7903	the law He is a de facto priest a king priest during the patriarchal period
2:11:52	7912	Okay So so then when here it in verse 15 it
2:12:00	7920	talks about it is clear still if another priest arises
2:12:05	7925	Okay Because what it's talking about uh the context for that another priest here
2:12:11	7931	is verse 14 For it is evident that our Lord was descended from
2:12:17	7937	Judah Okay Judahites can't be priests Okay they can't be priests Priests have
2:12:24	7944	to come from the tribe of Levi and specifically from the family of Aaron
2:12:31	7951	Okay so verse 14 it is evident that our Lord was descended from Judah a tribe
2:12:38	7958	with reference to which Moses spoke nothing concerning priests All right So um there's no
2:12:48	7968	basically means through the law for which a Judahite can become a
2:12:54	7974	priest Okay Now verse 15 This is clear
2:13:00	7980	still If another priest arises according to the likeness of
2:13:07	7987	Melkazedc what's the likeness of Melzdc the priest king a king who is
2:13:14	7994	also a priest Now that is forbidden by Mosaic law but it has precedent
2:13:22	8002	still Okay So because it has
2:13:27	8007	precedent it can happen but it can't happen through the normal opaces of the
2:13:35	8015	Levitical law It's got to happen through some other means
2:13:41	8021	And verse 16 lays out what those means are 16 says "Who has become such not on
2:13:50	8030	the basis of a law a physical requirement that's descendant of Levite
2:13:57	8037	but according to the power of an indestructible
2:14:02	8042	life." That indestructible life is the reference to the
2:14:08	8048	resurrection Verse 17 for it is witnessed of him thou
2:14:14	8054	art a priest forever according to the order of Melkazedc It basically the order of
2:14:21	8061	MelkiseDC is a oneoff priesthood essentially from Melkazedc
2:14:27	8067	first and then through Jesus Christ through that power of not only being the
2:14:33	8073	the king of kings by physical requirement but then he is resurrected
2:14:40	8080	from the dead becoming the the the priest according to MelkiseDC forever Okay So
2:14:49	8089	the fact that he cannot be destroyed he is now an everlasting everliving
2:14:56	8096	king He is now entered into that priesthood of of Melkisedc through that
2:15:04	8104	power of being
2:15:09	8109	resurrected So that's what it means to be a priest
2:15:14	8114	of the order of MelkiseDC So one you're not of the tribe of Levi
2:15:20	8120	Two uh you're a king Three you're resurrected from the
2:15:28	8128	dead Okay So that's what this this passage of
2:15:33	8133	Hebrews 7:15 to 7:3 means in a nutshell it it it lays out three requirements uh
2:15:40	8140	for for that whole Melkchisedc priesthood
2:15:47	8147	Okay so I hope that helps Thank you very much for the super chat Very much
2:15:55	8155	appreciated
2:16:01	8161	Okay All right Andrew Guler for $20 Thank you for the
2:16:08	8168	super chat In a previous live stream you mentioned that the coast of Palestine does not have a deep sea port necessary
2:16:15	8175	for seafaring If so how does the tribe of Dan have ships song of Deborah Judges
2:16:21	8181	5:17 Uh they had the they they took over um Zebulon's um inheritance and they had
2:16:30	8190	the port of Japa Okay Now one of the things about Japa is it's not a deep sea
2:16:38	8198	port but it is a port It's a fishing port Okay Now later on it is converted
2:16:47	8207	into a deep sea port but that's their port That's the port that Dan has is Dan
2:16:53	8213	has that uh the city of Japa Okay
2:16:58	8218	So um Japa is a very interesting uh has a very interesting history It's um it it
2:17:08	8228	started off as a shallow bay port Um so
2:17:13	8233	it's it's perfectly appropriate for fishing fleets and the Tribadan had a fishing fleet Okay But it's not a deep
2:17:21	8241	sea port It was a port that was used the later on converted to a deep sea port um
2:17:28	8248	and it was used by the crusaders It was probably the most important port on the on the um in in the Levant for say the
2:17:39	8259	crusades Uh it was used a lot by crusader
2:17:45	8265	ships It was an incredibly important port in the Middle Ages Incredibly important port in the Middle Ages
2:17:53	8273	But before its conversion to a deep sea port uh it was
2:17:58	8278	a what would we call as I say a shallow a shallow port Okay Um the only real
2:18:05	8285	deep sea port on that uh coast was
2:18:11	8291	uh uh was Cesaria That was the only one on the on the coast there
2:18:17	8297	But um that was that was basically again another um port that was
2:18:24	8304	um made a deep sea port uh by Herod the
2:18:32	8312	Great Yeah Yeah They're impressive Yeah They're the those ports the ones that
2:18:37	8317	Herod um converted were very impressive
2:18:47	8327	Scott Warworth and Japa rebelled against Tutmos as the third successor That'd be Almond Hobed the second Um had to be put
2:18:54	8334	down by force Oh yeah absolutely Yeah Yeah That that doesn't surprise me
2:19:00	8340	one bit Um and it's on the coastal plane there So I mean uh the Egyptians were
2:19:06	8346	very very sensitive about anything that sort of went down on the coastal plane anyway Um Japas being on the on the
2:19:14	8354	coastal plane Yeah absolutely It would have um ticked off the Egyptians if if
2:19:20	8360	they had
2:19:26	8366	rebelled Okay so that's how Dan has ships Even though that port is not a
2:19:32	8372	deep sea port but it is an really important port Okay Dappa was an is was
2:19:38	8378	an incredibly important port
2:19:44	8384	Okay Andrew Gler for $20 Thank you for the super chat Uh The Mummy 1999 Great movie Love
2:19:51	8391	that movie Uh introduced the idea that the ancient Egyptians had elite warriors called the Magi Uh not the magi it's
2:19:59	8399	magi But okay Uh me d a y or j
2:20:06	8406	ai Is that true no Okay But yes All right It's it's
2:20:15	8415	um here's here's what was true Here's what's not true Okay Um there were
2:20:22	8422	people called the magi Again it's magi not magi Um but they weren't elite warriors
2:20:31	8431	Okay Uh they um the mummy of 1999
2:20:38	8438	um dates the mummy to the time of STI the first So that's early dynasty
2:20:45	8445	19 In dynasty 19 the magi were not warriors anymore
2:20:51	8451	Uh they were at that point the magi were community leaders um
2:20:57	8457	constables guards um police
2:21:04	8464	officers Yeah Before that that they were guarding both sides of the fence
2:21:12	8472	Yeah Uh the whole story of the magi is very interesting Basically they sort of
2:21:18	8478	ran this um this scam where um uh during
2:21:24	8484	the second intermediate period the magi worked for both sides They worked for
2:21:30	8490	the Egyptians and they worked for the Nubians and they were
2:21:37	8497	basically mercenaries doing basically border patrols And when they came across each
2:21:44	8504	other's forces they just have lunch Okay They didn't fight each other They they just had
2:21:51	8511	lunch Oh yeah It kept conflict on the border way down But um but most of the first never caught on
2:21:59	8519	to this and he eventually w rewarded them for their loyal service by making
2:22:06	8526	them guards um community um representatives police
2:22:12	8532	officers constables more them than police officers but
2:22:18	8538	uh basically they're peace officers as such but they weren't elite warriors
2:22:24	8544	And uh even when they were mercenaries they were never elite warriors as such
2:22:30	8550	Okay So um this basically the idea that was
2:22:35	8555	proposed here by the mummy even though it's really a great film isn't isn't true Okay So I hope that helps Thank you
2:22:43	8563	for the super chat Very much appreciated
2:22:49	8569	Danny Dement friendly reminder that the mummy supports a late Exodus date It
2:22:55	8575	does Ironically Oh
2:23:00	8580	yeah Because uh remember when the buddy uh Benny is is is bring out all those
2:23:06	8586	amulets and he starts talking about those various languages He speaks in
2:23:11	8591	Hebrew and the mummy says the language of the slaves And he's supposed to be buried
2:23:18	8598	during the reign of Si which is Ramsey's II's father
2:23:26	8606	It's an interesting connection Yeah Oh that that that scene is hilariously
2:23:33	8613	funny but interesting too It's a very interesting scene
2:23:46	8626	Yes it does support a late Exodus That movie does support a late Exodus date and a lot of people just missed it Just
2:23:53	8633	missed it Yeah it's a cool movie It's a very cool
2:24:00	8640	movie Not accurate Benny Yeah a little buddy Benny
2:24:16	8656	Yeah that wrong side of the river joke was
2:24:22	8662	funny Okay so there you go Uh there were there were magi they
2:24:29	8669	just weren't elite warriors So hope that helps Thank you for the super chat Very much appreciated
2:24:35	8675	But again great film Love that film Okay Andrew Cooler for $20 Thank
2:24:42	8682	you for the super chat What is it about the Song of Deborah that many scholars are convinced
2:24:48	8688	that it is the oldest part of the Bible and it dates back to the 1200s BC um
2:24:55	8695	okay Um it doesn't date to the 1200s Um it that's probably a century
2:25:04	8704	too late Um it the the the fact is it probably
2:25:12	8712	more dates to the 1100s Okay But that's okay That's that's just a hundred years But
2:25:19	8719	um what it is what makes people think the song of Deborah is old is that it's
2:25:26	8726	poetry Now here's what people uh a lot of
2:25:32	8732	scholars think Poetry is a precursor to
2:25:37	8737	pros Therefore if you have a poetic section it's uses archaic language
2:25:44	8744	Therefore it must be older than the pros I think this is so wrong I think
2:25:52	8752	this is so messed up
2:26:00	8760	Poetry in almost every language uses
2:26:07	8767	archaisms That's something we find in poetry
2:26:13	8773	everywhere Uh the second thing is that poetry doesn't predate
2:26:20	8780	pros Um this is a literary theory that was debunked ages ago
2:26:26	8786	I mean it's been debunked for over a century but yet for some reason this
2:26:32	8792	still persists among biblical scholarship that because it's a poem
2:26:38	8798	it's got to be
2:26:45	8805	older Yeah it's not true but it should be right yeah that sort of thing
2:26:51	8811	Mama says "Poetry is easy to recall orally but arguing it came before pros
2:26:56	8816	is ridiculous." Yeah Well especially since we do have
2:27:01	8821	contemporary sources in the ancient near east particularly Egypt that combine poetry
2:27:09	8829	and pros in the same document you know like we have for
2:27:15	8835	example the annals of Tutmosis III you know and the battle of Kadesh
2:27:21	8841	you know these are sections like in the battle of Kadesh there is a pro section and a poetry section
2:27:28	8848	In the mptistila there's a pro section and a poetry section Same document
2:27:34	8854	written same time there They date to exactly the same
2:27:40	8860	time One is not older because it has poetry in it And the poetry has
2:27:49	8869	archaisms Huh Funny that But it's written at the same time
2:27:55	8875	as the pros It's it's an outofdate obsolete literary theory that
2:28:02	8882	just refuses to die in biblical
2:28:13	8893	studies BC modern day modern day poems must have been written in 1200 BC because poetry is old
2:28:20	8900	Yeah that's it's it's it's that kind of reasoning bully thinking
2:28:26	8906	Mama it's like arguing that multiplication came before division What yeah pretty
2:28:32	8912	much Yeah it's Yeah it's that that sort of rationale It's it's as I said it's
2:28:39	8919	it's obsolete literary theory that just
2:28:45	8925	thumbs its nose at the facts It thumbs it nose at the evidence
2:28:53	8933	So but that's that's the reason why they claim this is because the song of
2:28:59	8939	Deborah has Hebrew archaisms in it and it's poetry because these documents were
2:29:06	8946	passed orally It must predate the pros There's just no evidence for that this
2:29:13	8953	sort of development took place in ancient sources
2:29:20	8960	and tons of contrary evidence to the effect Again we got lots and lots of
2:29:27	8967	documents from Egypt that have both poetry and pros in the same document that were written at the same time
2:29:35	8975	Poetry has archaisms the pros doesn't But you know what they're provable that they were
2:29:42	8982	written at the same time because they're dated at the same time So yeah it just this is something
2:29:50	8990	that just drives me nuts again about biblical scholarship It's pig ignorant about say the primary
2:29:57	8997	sources but it just doubles down on obsolete literary theories
2:30:09	9009	Okay next uh super chat here is from Johnny Mo for $20 Thank you for the super chat What do you think of the idea of a
2:30:16	9016	gradual unveiling of the character of God to help explain things like harsh judgments in the Old Testament mercy on
2:30:23	9023	the Assyrians and Jonah and culminating in the person of Jesus see Matthew 13:17
2:30:28	9028	Let's take a look at Matthew 13:17 here then I'll comment
2:30:38	9038	Matthew 13
2:30:43	9043	17 for truly I say to you many pro there that many prophets and righteous men desire to see what you see and did not
2:30:50	9050	see it and hear what you hear and did not hear it Okay
2:30:57	9057	Uh yes this is called theologians call this
2:31:03	9063	progressive revelation that's what this is um in I mean this is this is almost
2:31:09	9069	accepted as fact amongst theologians okay um that this is that that
2:31:15	9075	revelation is progressive okay so
2:31:20	9080	um so this is what we're talking about here where God doesn't dump everything on people at once but he slowly teases
2:31:29	9089	it out over time through supplemental revelations through additive revelation
2:31:35	9095	through that sort of thing And the whole process is called progressive revelation
2:31:41	9101	So this is um this is again um now some of those
2:31:48	9108	some of the things you've said here are a little bit of a oversimplification like um the gradual
2:31:56	9116	unveiling of the character of God to explain things like harsh judgments in the Old Testament Not
2:32:02	9122	necessarily uh I would say that not necessarily harsh but culturally
2:32:08	9128	appropriate Okay Um and that's there there is a nuance there that I think we need to balance Some of the judgments
2:32:15	9135	were not so harsh as they were culturally appropriate but God's working
2:32:21	9141	within human culture to bring um to unveil who he is through it So I think
2:32:30	9150	we got to be a little cautious there The mercy on the Assyrians in Jonah Again that's that's sort of
2:32:37	9157	something that's been a constant theme in um in the Old Testament which is
2:32:44	9164	um that Israelite religion was supposed to reach out to the
2:32:50	9170	non-Israelite and it culminating in the person of Jesus Christ Again he's the consummation of all of
2:32:56	9176	that So again this is all consistent with the idea of progressive
2:33:02	9182	revelation And there are many theologians that do talk about progressive revelation So um yeah it's
2:33:10	9190	it's a it's a well-known concept inside of a theology So I hope that helped
2:33:15	9195	Thank you very much for the super chat Very much appreciate it Uh Mike JSB for $2 Thank you for the
2:33:23	9203	super chat Have you read Nigro's recent preliminary report which one he's had
2:33:30	9210	several Um he's had one in uh the last one of I
2:33:38	9218	read his I read two of his 2023 reports
2:33:43	9223	Um one on Jericho and or two both are on Jericho One is on um late Bronze Age
2:33:50	9230	Jericho The other one is on early Bronze Age Jericho Okay Um these both came out in 2023 Um they're um the one on early
2:34:00	9240	Bronze Age has passed its publication embargo is now available online for free
2:34:06	9246	I still I think the one the other one on the late Bronze Age is still under publication embargo but I have read it
2:34:14	9254	So I I don't know which report you're talking about here So you'd have to be more specific He's done a lot of
2:34:19	9259	preliminary reports on Jericho So anyway thank you very much Super chat Very much appreciated
2:34:27	9267	Uh Mike JSB for $2 Uh thank you for the super chat Is Telbond a problem for the 13th century conquest um not
2:34:36	9276	necessarily Um it's something that is raises a
2:34:42	9282	question But again what we're dealing here with in Tel Hashban is an absence of evidence Now
2:34:50	9290	um okay if it's a 2024 report I haven't read it Uh I haven't read the 2024
2:35:00	9300	report Yeah I'd have I I don't have a copy of that that report So again that's
2:35:05	9305	something I'd have to look up Um and that is one of those that is one of
2:35:11	9311	those journals that has a a pretty harsh uh embargo So
2:35:18	9318	um the last one I've read was the 2023 report
2:35:27	9327	Okay So um
2:35:36	9336	um but the 2023 report yeah he mentions the uh he might mention the collapsed
2:35:42	9342	late bronze one Well he also mentions that though in the 2023 report too What he mentions in the 2023 report though is
2:35:48	9348	the late bronze 2 beware And um that's an important thing is that that that uh
2:35:54	9354	late bronze 2 beware So okay now let's get back to the
2:36:00	9360	Telleshbond issue Um the Teshbon issue is has has been an ongoing issue for a
2:36:05	9365	while Again it's um they did an excavation at Heshbond Um and they did
2:36:11	9371	not find a late bronze 2 um destruction or occupation for Telbond
2:36:19	9379	Uh now there's a couple things that some things that could be going on here Um
2:36:24	9384	one the site moves I mean that has happened before where a site could be in one place and it picks up and it
2:36:31	9391	relocates at another time period Uh that happened at Migdal It happened at um
2:36:37	9397	Pitham Um it probably happened at Hotsour It happens from time to time
2:36:44	9404	It's even happened at Jericho you know the you got say um early to late uh to
2:36:52	9412	um bisantine Jericho and then the site
2:36:57	9417	picks up and moves to another location in the Roman period So you got a Roman age uh Jericho and then you have the the
2:37:05	9425	iron and bronze age Jericho and they're different sites So that can happen So
2:37:11	9431	so that's one possible things Another thing that could have happened at Tel Hasheshban was sight leveling Okay Same
2:37:17	9437	thing that happened to to late Bron's 2B Jericho could have happened to Teshban
2:37:22	9442	as well So that's a possibility as well that um after Heshbon was destroyed a
2:37:28	9448	later Israelites came leveled the site and then rebuilded on it during the iron
2:37:33	9453	age See so that that's a possibility as well So we can't exclude that possibility now from any site that where
2:37:41	9461	we don't find something So because of that whole site
2:37:47	9467	leveling thing now uh yeah all bets are off as to absence of evidence arguments
2:37:54	9474	I mean it should have been anyway Absence of evidence arguments are  arguments I mean they're
2:38:03	9483	terrible Yeah We finally found positive evidence of why there's
2:38:09	9489	absence So that's going to be an issue for for any of sites going forward that
2:38:14	9494	claim oh well it didn't happen here because we don't find evidence Okay now we got a we got a
2:38:22	9502	potential reason why something might not be
2:38:28	9508	there So yeah it it's also the case of Gibian
2:38:34	9514	as well So so it's it really is going to um we're going to have to reassess a lot
2:38:40	9520	of these sites Now um one of the things for example like at
2:38:45	9525	Heshbhon tell Heshbond one of the things they they there is some late bronze 2B
2:38:51	9531	pottery at Heshbond Um it's in the site report Okay
2:38:58	9538	The Teshban um does have there is late bronze 2B pottery found at
2:39:06	9546	Teshban What's not found there is the remains of a city
2:39:12	9552	Now here's the here's the here's the funky thing about hell heshbond is
2:39:20	9560	um that everyone recognizes that there is blade bronze tube pottery at Teshban
2:39:26	9566	but they just say well you know this is just some random people walking uh using the site you know as a campsite You know
2:39:32	9572	they're their temporary residence Well how do they know that there's no context for that pottery other than it's late
2:39:39	9579	Bronze 2b Okay So everyone recognizes that there's
2:39:47	9587	pots 2B pottery at Tellesbond just not a city That sounds eerily like what we
2:39:54	9594	what we had at Jericho Okay Eerily like what we had at Jericho you know we had at Jericho we
2:40:02	9602	had you know a middle bronze city and
2:40:08	9608	then it just sort of the strategist skips from from middle bronze two or
2:40:16	9616	three depending on your periodation to Iron
2:40:21	9621	Age Well we now know that there was occupation from you know the end of
2:40:29	9629	basically late bronze 1 all the way through to late bronze
2:40:35	9635	2b We have late bronze 2 pottery at Jericho We got fragments of a
2:40:42	9642	destruction layer Not a big one but fragments in some of the
2:40:47	9647	houses So so yeah this is this is again all
2:40:53	9653	bets are off on absence of evidence arguments now And I really think that
2:40:59	9659	people who still double down on these absence of evidence arguments are bad historians They're bad historians
2:41:07	9667	Okay So I don't think Teshbon is a problem anymore Um it shouldn't have
2:41:13	9673	been a problem to begin with but now we have justification as to why it's not a
2:41:18	9678	problem anymore Which
2:41:24	9684	one um geological shift not man Yeah that's a positive potential thing too Um
2:41:30	9690	that's happened before earthquakes um or like for example um earthquakes
2:41:38	9698	and uh can change how things um you know you know progress
2:41:45	9705	um like early Bronze Age um Jericho was destroyed by an
2:41:51	9711	earthquake an earthquake caused the abandonment of Betha or Bethesda depending on how you
2:41:58	9718	want to pronounce it but Betha um was abandoned because of an earthquake that
2:42:04	9724	caused the site to elevate which caused the Sea of Galilee to recede 40 miles
2:42:12	9732	from this fishing village So um people just abandon the
2:42:18	9738	abandon the fishing village because there's no more sea there
2:42:23	9743	Yeah bad fishing after that So geology can play a role in these
2:42:29	9749	things too But there's a lots of reasons why these things can happen Water supply dries up You
2:42:36	9756	know dang that's a heck of an uplift Yeah it is Um you know this is like uh but it
2:42:44	9764	also led to the preservation of this too Uh in fact I think in the Israeli
2:42:50	9770	antiquities um um authority now has made Betha an archaeological park This is now
2:42:57	9777	the park of the disciples because this is the home of Peter Okay This is the
2:43:02	9782	hometown of Peter And ironically it was
2:43:07	9787	preserved This this fishing village was preserved because of the earthquake
2:43:14	9794	earthquake pushed it up like 40 feet The water just rushed away from it and
2:43:20	9800	people said "Uh where did the sea
2:43:28	9808	go?" And they picked up and moved closer to the ocean or the Sea of Galloway where they could resume
2:43:37	9817	fishing But yeah geology plays can play a role in this too Lots of reasons for this
2:43:44	9824	Okay so anyway I hope that helps Thank you for the super chat Very much
2:43:49	9829	appreciate it Okay Esther for $2 Hey Esther How's
2:43:56	9836	it going it's good to see you here tonight Why would Elizabeth keep secluded luke 124 Oh interesting
2:44:04	9844	question Okay Luke 1 verse
2:44:13	9853	24 All right This is a very interesting Now this is this is talking about the um
2:44:20	9860	um the pregnancy of Elizabeth um who is going to give birth to um John
2:44:27	9867	the Baptist Okay Now verse 24 it reads after these days Elizabeth his wife
2:44:35	9875	became pregnant and she kept herself in seclusion for 5 months saying this is
2:44:41	9881	the way the Lord has dealt with me in the days when he looked with favor upon me to take away my disgrace among men
2:44:49	9889	Okay Now the question is
2:44:57	9897	um what is happening here that would cause Elizabeth to go into seclusion for
2:45:02	9902	5 months now there's nothing in the Levitical law that says a pregnant woman has to go into seclusion Nothing So this
2:45:10	9910	is not something that's caused by um anything that's written in the
2:45:18	9918	Bible But what we get here is a hint from verse 25
2:45:25	9925	um where she says this is the way the Lord has dealt with me in these in the days when he looked with favor upon me
2:45:33	9933	to take away and this is the key portion here Take away my disgrace among
2:45:39	9939	men Here's what's happening Elizabeth is barren
2:45:45	9945	Okay Now here's what I think and scholars are going to disagree on this because again
2:45:52	9952	this is not a clear passage okay because it's not again we don't have a precedent
2:45:58	9958	in the Old Testament to say why should you be in seclusion But here's my thought on this Um
2:46:08	9968	um what is um Elizabeth is barren Okay And that's a
2:46:16	9976	that's a mark of shame right now Okay
2:46:21	9981	But the other mark of shame that could happen
2:46:27	9987	to is
2:46:32	9992	um uh what we would call today
2:46:37	9997	um um peacos Okay polycystic ovarian syndrome
2:46:44	10004	Okay Where a woman can start packing on a little weight at the waist but her
2:46:51	10011	their thighs sort of um uh lose muscle tone
2:46:59	10019	Okay This was associated not just with barrenness
2:47:04	10024	um and polycystic ovarian uh syndrome can cause infertility causes
2:47:11	10031	infertility but it was also seen in Israelite culture as
2:47:17	10037	being how do I say this the result of infidelity
2:47:26	10046	Okay So uh we talked a bit a while ago about the a h a husband accuses a wife
2:47:34	10054	of infidelity and she goes and they perform
2:47:39	10059	a ceremony in front of the priest where they she drinks um a water with
2:47:46	10066	some ash in it And what can happen um if if God
2:47:52	10072	decides that she was um
2:47:59	10079	cheating she would she would develop this condition where the the the abdomen
2:48:05	10085	becomes distended and the legs lose muscle tone And essentially it's the
2:48:11	10091	it's a symptom of infertility Okay it's a symptom of infertility The idea of this is that if
2:48:18	10098	she had she takes a vow before God that she didn't cheat and if she cheated she would be struck infertile
2:48:25	10105	Okay Now one of the problems with polycystic
2:48:32	10112	uh ovarian um syndrome is it can look like early stage
2:48:41	10121	pregnancy Okay It can look like early stage pregnancy
2:48:49	10129	And it was it could be
2:48:55	10135	seen that Elizabeth had sort of the the
2:49:01	10141	look of somebody with this kind of infertility She had been she had been
2:49:07	10147	pregnant or she had been barren most of her marriage She was a barren woman She
2:49:12	10152	had no but now she starts looking like she's a little
2:49:18	10158	pregnant Yeah Okay People are going to start talking They're going to start
2:49:23	10163	talking out of ignorance that she was was
2:49:29	10169	cheating She was cheating and she was starting to look like a woman who had been struck
2:49:35	10175	infertile Okay Because of of of infidelity So what she does is she hides
2:49:42	10182	for five months so nobody sees her in her early
2:49:48	10188	stages of pregnancy She emerges after five months when it's clear she's pregnant
2:49:55	10195	Okay where she's big enough that it's no longer in doubt that
2:50:01	10201	she's pregnant So she avoids the accusation of
2:50:07	10207	infidelity by staying in seclusion until it's clear that she is pregnant not suffering from
2:50:16	10216	this kind of infertility
2:50:22	10222	Okay Oh yeah Totally sucked
2:50:28	10228	Yeah Mama says "I figured that figured because her husband wasn't allowed to talk she went in seclusion to avoid the
2:50:35	10235	awkward conversations in general." Well okay He wasn't allowed to talk but that
2:50:42	10242	also means he can't say anything to defend her either
2:50:49	10249	Yeah mama Yesesh Both her and Mary had so much to deal with Oh yeah
2:51:01	10261	Absolutely Oh yeah It's Yeah You don't want to be chosen by God It's for that thing Yeah
2:51:15	10275	BC but Dr Faulk the the the the gospels made it up Why include such random
2:51:23	10283	details because details are important It's the little things that
2:51:29	10289	[Laughter] matter man
2:51:36	10296	If you can get the little things right it lends credibility to the stuff And
2:51:42	10302	that's what I think is going on here is we've got these little details here that
2:51:47	10307	would have you know explained why she's going into seclusion at that particular time
2:51:55	10315	And again it's a this is about shame and disgrace That's why she's in hiding to
2:52:00	10320	avoid shame and disgrace you know she's already barren but now she starts showing the
2:52:07	10327	signs of infertility when she's actually fertile That would bring extra shame and
2:52:14	10334	disgrace Yeah And then she can't celebrate this This is not then um something
2:52:19	10339	that Yeah It's just you know she's kind of in a lose-lose
2:52:24	10344	situation You know she if she's barren she's shamed If she's
2:52:32	10352	infertile which shows the signs of infertility on top of that she's double
2:52:38	10358	shamed So she can't win Um so she has to stay in seclusion until it's obvious
2:52:46	10366	that she she's with child Yeah This is the mother of John
2:52:52	10372	the Baptist Yeah
2:52:57	10377	you know so it's it's kind of she doesn't really if she wants to maintain the respectability and and and her
2:53:04	10384	father and and her husband's a priest Her husband's a priest So it's not just shame on her
2:53:10	10390	it's shame on him too
2:53:16	10396	So so it's I they just decided it was the best for everybody She's just be in
2:53:22	10402	seclusion for 5 months until it's obvious what's going
2:53:27	10407	on Okay So I hope that helps Esther thank you very much for that question It's an interesting question and uh
2:53:34	10414	that's again uh scholars differ on this but that's what I think is going on here
2:53:43	10423	Okay next one here is from Esther for $5 Thank you for the super chat When people more educated than I
2:53:49	10429	disagree how can the lame person discern truth and speak confident oo
2:53:57	10437	Uh that's a tough question Um that's a tough
2:54:05	10445	question Uh this is why I always suggest you go back to the word of God Okay
2:54:11	10451	go back to the word of God really examine it and you know compare compare the
2:54:19	10459	options You know there's nothing nothing preventing you from if if you
2:54:26	10466	um if you disagree with an expert The expert's not automatically right I mean I proved tonight I'm not automatically
2:54:32	10472	right Okay Okay Experts can get things
2:54:38	10478	wrong you know and you know they're human We're everyone's human We all make
2:54:45	10485	mistakes Okay Do you double down on the mistakes well that's where you have to use
2:54:52	10492	discernment to figure this out I'm not saying it's easy okay um it could be
2:55:00	10500	very very difficult to discern between two different experts on
2:55:06	10506	something But then again that's that's what's incumbent upon us
2:55:12	10512	So um what I would do in in in the case
2:55:17	10517	where say an expert and I would disagree is I'd go to the commentaries I'd look things up research it Research it see
2:55:27	10527	what a variety of opinions says on it You know don't just trust one source
2:55:32	10532	Consult many sources Yeah Yeah What's their context what's
2:55:38	10538	their biases what's what did they publish before you know do they have a
2:55:49	10549	Yeah My my producer asks you know is this a denominational difference is this
2:55:55	10555	an academic difference is this a presuppositional difference you know is
2:56:01	10561	this the I mean is this a Is this something they were talking Sunday school they didn't do you know is this
2:56:08	10568	something they're just repeating from Sunday school yep I mean experts do that
2:56:14	10574	You know experts do that I mean they they I mean nobody escapes their Sunday
2:56:19	10579	school training Even experts
2:56:27	10587	Uh Andrew Graeme are we assuming they're an expert well are they an expert i mean you get people who are
2:56:34	10594	more more educated on certain subjects that aren't actually
2:56:40	10600	experts you know So again um you know you just you just have
2:56:49	10609	to mama No one escapes Sunday school unscathed Exactly Um yeah Um Sunday school
2:56:58	10618	theology has done a lot of damage It's done a lot of damage It's done a lot of good but it's also done a lot of harm
2:57:08	10628	too Uh Keeps Learning says "It must be hard for experts to admit they're wrong all along when they've built their
2:57:15	10635	careers on a wrong interpretation like the early Exodus." Yeah it is Um look
2:57:20	10640	here's the thing Um most experts aren't
2:57:27	10647	evidentialists Oh they like to say they follow the evidence but they really don't Most
2:57:34	10654	experts will essentially just double down on whatever
2:57:41	10661	they were they were taught whatever they sort of picked up And the very few
2:57:47	10667	experts change their mind you know along the way Uh a few that have integrity do and
2:57:55	10675	it really frustrates all the other experts Um you know there seems to be this this ongoing expectation in the um
2:58:03	10683	academic world that once you have your PhD you you stop stop growing and
2:58:10	10690	learning and following the evidence Well yeah that might be convenient in
2:58:17	10697	the academic world but it's not very smart You know it's not very
2:58:27	10707	smart you know So you know people tend to become oified in their in their
2:58:32	10712	knowledge and their opinion You know they get to to a point in their education where they learn all they want
2:58:38	10718	to learn and that's it that they stop learning and then they just repeat what they
2:58:45	10725	learned Which is why you have these people who are still sort of spouting
2:58:50	10730	obsolete views you know and and and they just don't ever
2:58:55	10735	think about it because thinking is hard It hurts Okay So
2:59:03	10743	um and I mean there was um who was I forget who said this
2:59:10	10750	Theories don't convince academics They what happens is academics
2:59:18	10758	simply die off Okay So the idea here is
2:59:26	10766	that you know evidence doesn't convince academics
2:59:31	10771	What happens is the old academics die and a new generation comes along that
2:59:38	10778	has fresh thinking Okay
2:59:45	10785	So so that's how that's how things change in the academic world is it
2:59:54	10794	doesn't it's not a matter of of who has the best evidence It's that whoever has
2:59:59	10799	the best evidence convinces the young academics to accept it and then the old ones just simply die
3:00:09	10809	off So I'm getting back to the original
3:00:14	10814	question here How do you um how do you discern the
3:00:22	10822	truth and then speak confidently of it is you've got
3:00:27	10827	to you've got to figure it out for yourself You got to figure it out And
3:00:33	10833	there's no easy way to do this No easy way to do
3:00:38	10838	this Oh Jack Ray showed up Cool Yeah Um
3:00:44	10844	Jack Ray says "Uh even lawyers have continuing legal education requirements." Yeah they
3:00:50	10850	do Yeah Yeah Even teachers uh school teachers have you know they're required
3:00:57	10857	to do a certain amount of learning every year Yeah There's just no easy way to do
3:01:05	10865	this okay you just have to sort of bite the bullet and then try to figure it out
3:01:10	10870	yourself Okay you can ask people you trust You can ask experts you trust or
3:01:16	10876	people who who who maybe know better than you Um and I would I would highly encourage that and that's one of the
3:01:23	10883	reasons we do this um channel on these live streams is to take the questions
3:01:28	10888	like um that are say maybe more difficult um so that people can sort of okay get
3:01:36	10896	another perspective on it Yeah We don't expect you to believe us on everything we say What we do expect is that you
3:01:44	10904	take what we give you and then evaluate it weigh the evidence weigh the
3:01:50	10910	arguments and then come to the conclusion yourself Okay so that's what I would suggest here
3:01:58	10918	Oh thank you very much for the super chat Very much
3:02:05	10925	appreciated Yeah Andrew Grim says "Even cleaners need training when methods change." Sure Absolutely Yeah Yeah every
3:02:11	10931	field that's worth anything does this U here's the here's one of the
3:02:16	10936	things even fiction authors you know if they're not constantly learning their
3:02:22	10942	craft and it's a craft You know fiction writing is a craft If you're not
3:02:27	10947	constantly learning your craft um and Stephen King said this once which I think is really
3:02:34	10954	interesting you know he said Stephen King you know he's he's written like many bestsellers He says he's constantly
3:02:40	10960	learning the craft of writing And he said that if you don't learn the craft of writing your writing
3:02:46	10966	gets stale And this is what happens to a lot of of say fiction authors that stop
3:02:54	10974	learning the craft is it gets stale Every person in every major
3:03:02	10982	field has to keep learning otherwise your knowledge gets
3:03:07	10987	stale
3:03:15	10995	Mhm Yeah Yeah You
3:03:22	11002	know Mama King needs to keep working on it Yeah Yeah Pretty scary huh yeah
3:03:30	11010	Stephen King keeps needs to keep working on his writing Yeah I know it's scary but but
3:03:36	11016	it's true If you want to stay fresh as a writer you have to constantly keep working on your writing learning the
3:03:44	11024	craft Pianists do you know pianist I mean anybody who
3:03:49	11029	does the arts you know if you're a painter you have to keep learning the
3:03:54	11034	craft Otherwise your your paint has become old and sort of prosaic
3:04:03	11043	Okay next one here is from Esther for $5 Thank you for the super
3:04:09	11049	chat And she go she asks "Any book or video recommendations to learn how to
3:04:16	11056	think more like an Old Testament Israelite or a New Testament Jew?" Yes actually I do I recommend the books by
3:04:23	11063	of uh John Walton Okay Uh his Lost World
3:04:28	11068	series Okay That's what I would recommend here Uh John Walton does an excellent
3:04:35	11075	job of of getting into the nitty-gritty of say the context of the ancient
3:04:43	11083	Israelites Okay and he's got several books on this Um he he's got like the
3:04:49	11089	lost world of Genesis the lost world of the prophets uh the lost world of the
3:04:56	11096	judges Okay So I would highly highly recommend
3:05:03	11103	um John Walton's books for you know as a primer for
3:05:10	11110	um uh learning the context of of ancient Israelites All right so I hope that
3:05:17	11117	helps Thank you for the super chat Very much appreciate it Messianic Telmid for $5 Thank you for
3:05:24	11124	the super chat How similar is the creator God ta compared to Yahweh in the
3:05:31	11131	Bible only similar in one respect Okay Um the only similarity between Ta and
3:05:39	11139	Yahweh is the idea of fiat creation Okay Now what is fiat creation fiat creation
3:05:48	11148	is the idea that you can create through the power of your voice or your thoughts
3:05:57	11157	Okay Uh in the um Shabbaka Stila
3:06:03	11163	uh there on the Shabbaka stone there is this um sort of contest between the
3:06:10	11170	Mefit theology under Ta and the Helopllin theology under
3:06:16	11176	Rey And basically it's a sort of a a contest of who's the better
3:06:22	11182	god And Basically Ta says you know the me fights
3:06:28	11188	go "Oh Ta is the better god because he's he's he creates through his thoughts and
3:06:34	11194	through the power of his uh voice." The sun god Rey is the inferior
3:06:41	11201	god because he creates through the male sex act
3:06:48	11208	Okay So um that's about the only similarity
3:06:54	11214	though between Ta and Yahweh is Yahweh says "Let there be light." And there was
3:07:01	11221	light You know let Yahweh creates the power of his
3:07:06	11226	voice Ta also creates the power of his voice So so that's that's that's the only
3:07:14	11234	similarity between Now everything else is different between the two
3:07:19	11239	Okay yahweh is a transcendent God Ta lives inside his creation He's an
3:07:26	11246	imminent God Um Yahweh doesn't have a body Ta is
3:07:32	11252	a has a body and he's a mummy He's essentially a dead person wrapped up
3:07:38	11258	Okay So so that's where the similarities end
3:07:45	11265	is just that's the only point where the two are similar is in that one sort of of intersection of fiat creation That's
3:07:52	11272	the only way they're similar Okay so I hope that helps Thank you very much for the super chat Very much appreciate
3:08:00	11280	it All right Esther again for $5 Thank you very much for the super chat How would the disciples have understood
3:08:06	11286	Mark 8:34 before the crucifixion okay let's go to Mark
3:08:15	11295	Mark
3:08:20	11300	8 34 And the text reads "And he summoned the m multitude
3:08:25	11305	with his disciples and said to them if anyone wishes to come after me let him
3:08:31	11311	deny himself take up his cross and follow me For whoever wishes to save his
3:08:38	11318	life shall lose it but whoever loses his life for my sake and the gospel shall save it."
3:08:45	11325	Okay How would this have been understood really really
3:09:00	11340	poorly um this would not have been received well at all
3:09:06	11346	Uh in fact what ends up happening is this sort of talk
3:09:13	11353	um loses a lot of his followers
3:09:19	11359	Okay this is just over their heads Um if anyone wishes to come after
3:09:27	11367	me let him deny himself and take up his cross take up his
3:09:33	11373	execution Right I mean this is this is this is as to to a first century
3:09:40	11380	Israelite this would be like saying the modern the modern equivalent of this was "Hey if you want to come do what I do
3:09:48	11388	yeah you're going to have to to to give up everything and bring your electric
3:09:56	11396	chair." Yeah Yeah How do you think that's going to go over
3:10:02	11402	um because the cross is the sign of the
3:10:08	11408	executioner Okay Yeah you're going to be executed So not only are you going to
3:10:14	11414	have to give up all the pleasures of this world you're going to be executed too Yeah This is this is not going to go
3:10:21	11421	over well And it didn't Um in fact there comes to a a
3:10:30	11430	point where you know where Christ is going to say to his
3:10:37	11437	disciples and his followers "Yeah if you want to follow me you've got to eat my
3:10:44	11444	flesh and drink my blood." Well you know this
3:10:50	11450	is to a Jew is really abhorrent because it sounds like cannibalism
3:10:57	11457	and the the the followers of Christ say "Okay this saying is way too hard I
3:11:05	11465	don't get it but it sounds weird I'm out of here." So most of the followers end up
3:11:11	11471	abandoning Christ And then Christ says to finally to his disciples "Hey are you going to
3:11:17	11477	abandon me too?" And it I think it's Peter who says to Christ "Well where where will we go
3:11:24	11484	you have the words of life So in some ways this is going to
3:11:30	11490	mark the division between who's a disciple and
3:11:36	11496	who's a follower You know I kind I I I kind of I
3:11:41	11501	kind of bristle when I hear churches sort of rebrand themselves say "Well
3:11:47	11507	we're not we're not Christians We're Christ followers." [Music]
3:11:53	11513	Oh what
3:11:59	11519	huh cuz the followers of Christ they left you know when when the going got
3:12:06	11526	rough they got going up and and left the
3:12:13	11533	building It's the disciples who stuck around
3:12:23	11543	So so but it was stuff like this where he basically tells them hey yeah you
3:12:30	11550	know you know verse 36 what does it profit a man to gain the whole world and
3:12:35	11555	forfeit his soul yeah that's that's tough language
3:12:43	11563	And it was really tough for an an a first century Israelite to to say "Oh
3:12:50	11570	because they they I mean Jerusalem Judea have been a wash with
3:12:58	11578	parapotetic preachers and false messiahs." Yeah Christ wasn't the first
3:13:06	11586	messiah There were many false messiahs in the first century many of
3:13:13	11593	them and they were so used to to false messiahs blowing them sunshine Here
3:13:20	11600	comes this Messiah that is basically saying "Yeah you follow me You're you're going to
3:13:27	11607	die." A lot of people just stopped and said "Um yeah this is too heavy I'm
3:13:32	11612	checking out of this." Yeah Yeah that's a message Yeah
3:13:38	11618	exactly
3:13:45	11625	So yeah um Harry Stark says those imposters are
3:13:50	11630	forgotten Yeah they're imp they were mostly forgotten but there were many of
3:13:57	11637	many of them Andrew Grim says "Yeah we still have
3:14:02	11642	false messiahs today." Yeah many false messiahs
3:14:10	11650	Oh yeah there's there's there's hundreds of false messiahs running around the landscape And there were back then too
3:14:15	11655	That's nothing new
3:14:20	11660	Yeah a lot of them are in California and Florida A lot
3:14:27	11667	[Laughter] Yeah Yeah The supposed antichrist dude
3:14:33	11673	Yeah You know I don't think that guy's the Antichrist either Um there there is one thing that I think um
3:14:41	11681	um like uh there's there's that uh was it his album or something like that yeah
3:14:47	11687	The fake uh uh Yeah Darth Beanie Yeah Yeah There's this guy who's
3:14:54	11694	claiming to be like the antichrist and the final revelation of of the Messiah and all that that's running around right
3:14:59	11699	now He's claiming to bring you know a kind of Chrislam to the world It's like
3:15:05	11705	no no that just that's he's just another false teacher He's not he's not the antichrist He's just another false
3:15:13	11713	teacher Yeah Um the earlier Yeah If you claim to be the
3:15:20	11720	Antichrist you're probably not Okay
3:15:26	11726	um like we like we discussed in in um Daniel chapter 11 you know the
3:15:33	11733	antichrist is going to be Oh yeah He said he sub he made all
3:15:39	11739	sorts of outrageous claims Yeah Um
3:15:47	11747	um but um like for example um you know if you want to know who the antichrist
3:15:52	11752	is the description was in was in Daniel um 11 that we talked about today you
3:15:58	11758	know his the the the god of the antichrist is is weapons
3:16:05	11765	of war you know that's that's one of the things we see like in the book of revelation you know it talks about the
3:16:11	11771	anti Christ and they say who can make war like the
3:16:17	11777	antichrist like for example here's here's one of the things I think is is um you know when when people start
3:16:22	11782	guessing who is the antichrist okay uh let's see here let me see if I can find the passage that's okay
3:16:35	11795	but find this quickly if I can find this quickly I'll just
3:16:53	11813	All right One of the things about the
3:16:59	11819	Antichrist is his ability to make war Okay Revelation 12:17 And the dragon
3:17:06	11826	emerged from the woman and went off to make war with the rest of her offspring who keeps the commandments of of Jesus
3:17:13	11833	uh and hold to the testimony of Jesus
3:17:19	11839	Okay Uh Revelation 13:7 And it was given to him to make war
3:17:25	11845	with the saints and overcome them And the authority over every tribe and people and tongue and nation was given
3:17:30	11850	to him Okay and I saw the beast and the kings of the
3:17:36	11856	earth and all their armies assembled to make war against him who sat upon the horse against his army Well one of the
3:17:41	11861	things about the about the beast the antichrist is his ability to make war If
3:17:48	11868	he's no good at war he's not the antichrist Just
3:17:53	11873	saying That's that's probably one of the major requirements of the Antichrist is he has to be good at warfare
3:18:04	11884	Yeah that's what rules out 90% of the politicians okay is most of the politicians are incompetent at
3:18:12	11892	war You know this is this is what I think is really really funny is
3:18:27	11907	um every election Okay Bubble machine What would be the point of claiming to
3:18:32	11912	be the antichrist it's a claim Okay this there there's actually there's a twisted there's a
3:18:38	11918	twisted logic to this Okay most people who claim to be the antichrist also
3:18:44	11924	claim to be the Christ Okay So the twisted logic here is if you
3:18:53	11933	claim to be the Christ a false me if you claim to be a messiah and you claim to be his anti is
3:19:02	11942	his opposite The antichrist you can claim to be the
3:19:08	11948	fulfillment or the consummation of the Christ consciousness
3:19:15	11955	That's the twisted logic in this okay is by claiming you be both the Christ and
3:19:22	11962	the Antichrist you can claim to be the consummation of both and therefore
3:19:28	11968	everyone should follow you That's the twisted logic here
3:19:36	11976	So he's he's he's not I mean when when when these
3:19:43	11983	these these clowns claim to be the antichrist they're not claiming to be the devil incarnate You know are you the devil's
3:19:51	11991	representative they're claiming to be the the ying and the
3:19:58	11998	yang So they're they're claiming to be both the say the the the
3:20:06	12006	the peaceloving elements of the Christ and the powerful elements of the dark
3:20:13	12013	side of the Christ the
3:20:20	12020	antichrist Uh bubble machine So Mary Sue got complex issues Yeah Yeah
3:20:29	12029	Mama Yikes They're two timing trying to play both sides Exactly Yeah Those who claim
3:20:35	12035	to be both Christ and Antichrist they're they're playing both sides
3:20:41	12041	They're infusing they're they're they're trying to infuse say this idea with
3:20:54	12054	um with this sort of say eastern motif of say dowoism
3:21:01	12061	So they're they're trying to appeal to they're basically importing a kind of Dowoism into Christianity and then
3:21:09	12069	trying to be the representative of Christianity through that importation Uh keeps learning will the
3:21:16	12076	Antichrist be a Jew not necessarily It's possible but not
3:21:22	12082	necessarily Uh we're not sure what his ethnicity will be Some people have
3:21:28	12088	speculated that he will be sort of a representative of of the tribe of Dan
3:21:33	12093	The idea being that tribe of Dan is excluded But that
3:21:39	12099	that's that's an inference and I don't think it's a very good inference So maybe he's a Jew maybe he isn't
3:21:46	12106	Doesn't we we're not sure We can't be sure Um the Bible just doesn't tell us here
3:22:00	12120	Okay So
3:22:09	12129	Andrew Go he'll be an Aussie Laugh out loud
3:22:15	12135	Yeah Yeah
3:22:23	12143	Um Scott War Antichrist equals an atheistic wararmongering anti-semite
3:22:29	12149	Well he'll definitely be wararmongering Uh not necessarily atheistic Okay Uh and he will be an
3:22:37	12157	anti-semite Okay He'll be an anti-semite he'll be anti-Christian he'll be both
3:22:43	12163	Um not necessarily atheistic Um
3:22:50	12170	um but he might have pretenses of atheism It for him it just seems to be that uh from the looks of it
3:22:57	12177	that he's going to sidestep
3:23:03	12183	religion It could just he just could be a humanist Yeah Yeah He could be a
3:23:08	12188	technobat Yeah He could be a lot of things Not necessarily atheist
3:23:15	12195	Yeah So any and and the real Antichrist isn't just going to is not going to just come
3:23:21	12201	out and say "Oh I'm the Antichrist I'm from the devil." No No He's not going to do that That's
3:23:28	12208	stupid It's why we're told how to recognize him is because he's not going
3:23:34	12214	to announce that he's the Antichrist If he's if he's announcing he's the Antichrist he's probably not the
3:23:39	12219	Antichrist
3:23:46	12226	Yeah
3:23:52	12232	Andrew Graham says from the looks of it he won't be dumb No he won't be stupid Oh no He'll he'll definitely not
3:23:59	12239	be stupid He'll be he'll be very savvy
3:24:04	12244	He'll be very cunning Um he will probably use a type of
3:24:11	12251	religion for his ends which is why he he rides the the beast of of Babylon He's
3:24:19	12259	he's riding religion but he isn't religious
3:24:24	12264	himself At least he doesn't he doesn't do a public religion His religion
3:24:31	12271	is the god of fortresses warfare That's his religion
3:24:45	12285	Okay See very progressive Okay Mama charmer charismatic
3:24:52	12292	high-risisk Yeah he probably will be He'll probably quite be be quite
3:24:58	12298	charming Yeah Yeah He'll be a narcissist and he will be very charismatic
3:25:06	12306	And and frankly his his disciples will be kings He has disciples and they will be
3:25:16	12316	kings He only he only prefers high class disciples Okay Uh next one here is from
3:25:24	12324	Messianic Talbad for $5 Thank you for the super chat How similar are the fights and squables of Egyptian gods
3:25:31	12331	similar to those of Greek mythology um they're not that similar to be
3:25:37	12337	honest Um Egyptian gods tend not to fight except in pretty special
3:25:46	12346	circumstances The only gods that we have on record actually fighting are
3:25:53	12353	um uh the the of course the the the um contesting between Horus and Seth and
3:26:01	12361	that's over kingship of Egypt Then we also have the daily um the daily
3:26:09	12369	battle of the sun god with the serpent Apous All right And that's pretty much
3:26:15	12375	the limits of fights and squables between Egyptian
3:26:22	12382	gods So there isn't this constant warfare happening between the gods like you do find in the Greek mythology In
3:26:29	12389	Greek mythology you do find constant infighting and bickering and battles and
3:26:36	12396	conniving and intrigue You know Mars oh sorry Uh Aries
3:26:42	12402	you know gets on the battlefield and of the gods and then cowers out and runs Um
3:26:48	12408	no no you don't find any of that Not in Egyptian in Egyptian
3:26:55	12415	mythology anyway
3:27:02	12422	Okay so I hope that helps Thank you for the super chat Very much appreciate
3:27:09	12429	it Right Messi Adam Talmud for $5 Thank you for the super chat Uh did Egyptian gods physically get
3:27:17	12437	women pregnant like the Olympians no Okay Um and there's a
3:27:23	12443	reason There's a reason Now there's a no and a yes answer to
3:27:29	12449	this too Okay if it's a king
3:27:34	12454	um the gods were said to have played a role in the conception of a
3:27:41	12461	king And how that works was um the god Cane put
3:27:50	12470	the soul of the king on the potter's wheel created man on the potter's
3:27:55	12475	wheel and then Ammon Alman Ray and Moot
3:28:01	12481	had mommy and daddy time conceive the
3:28:07	12487	king which the great queen and the physical
3:28:13	12493	king when they had their king and queen private
3:28:19	12499	time conceived and then the gods implanted
3:28:24	12504	the baby god king came into the great queen and she got pregnant that way
3:28:34	12514	Okay so that's the exception The rule is generally no
3:28:42	12522	Okay So that that's the only case where you have a god
3:28:49	12529	um getting a woman pregnant is through the conception of a
3:28:55	12535	king Everyone else was conceived the normal way Okay Um but here's the thing And
3:29:03	12543	here's the reason why you had less claims to um um
3:29:10	12550	uh physical conception by a god too And the reason is because in
3:29:21	12561	um in Greek society there was a stigma attached to
3:29:28	12568	unwed motherhood Okay because there was a stigma attached to it in Greek
3:29:34	12574	Hellenistic society Uh women did often claim that they were impregnated by a god
3:29:42	12582	essentially fooled by a god shaped like a man
3:29:48	12588	who you know bent her will and um you know seduced her because of his divine
3:29:56	12596	powers and she conceived uh through divine means Okay
3:30:05	12605	Now unwed motherhood in Egypt did not carry that
3:30:13	12613	stigma Because it didn't carry that stigma there were very few claims of
3:30:20	12620	divine conception among the general population
3:30:27	12627	So it's a cultural reason why it didn't happen in Egypt
3:30:32	12632	you you got those claims in the ancient world where there were these stigmas
3:30:37	12637	Okay So where you didn't have the stigma there was um there was a there was none
3:30:43	12643	of that those claims of say divine conception or very few at any
3:30:52	12652	rate and Egypt had no as I said Egypt did not have that
3:30:58	12658	that stigma applied to single motherhood Now that's not saying single motherhood
3:31:03	12663	was wasn't hard It was very very difficult and it was in every
3:31:10	12670	culture and it did force a woman to do
3:31:15	12675	certain things that she wouldn't have had to do normally But because there was no stigma
3:31:22	12682	attached to single motherhood in Egypt she could still
3:31:28	12688	marry Okay because there was no stigma attached to single uh motherhood So she could still marry a
3:31:35	12695	man and there were avenues out for uh where she could say pursue a a normal
3:31:43	12703	life though being a single mother was not a end of the line in Egyptian
3:31:50	12710	culture whereas say in Greek culture and in Israelite culture yeah it was it was
3:31:57	12717	a big problem if that happened
3:32:03	12723	So
3:32:08	12728	okay so so anyway I hope that answers your question Thank you very much for the super chat very much
3:32:24	12744	appreciated Okay Daniel for $5 Thank you very much for the super chat First Kings 3:2 Would one of these
3:32:31	12751	high places be Mount Eel let's talk about that All right Um first
3:32:40	12760	kings So first kings 3 verse two All
3:32:50	12770	right And it talks about here the people were still sacrificing on the high
3:32:55	12775	places because there was no house built for the name of the Lord until these day those days All right So it's getting
3:33:03	12783	ready to we're getting here ready This is the during the time of Solomon and they're getting ready to build the
3:33:09	12789	temple Now it would not have included Mount
3:33:15	12795	Eel Why because the Mount Eel site only lasted about 50 years
3:33:25	12805	Mount Eelles site was kind of remote for it to be a good high
3:33:30	12810	place Now it could have become a high place It had all the potential to be a
3:33:37	12817	high place It just ended not being a high place because it as I said it only
3:33:43	12823	lasted for about 50 years and then it was shut down You know they built two altars
3:33:48	12828	there and that was it you know so you know its span of time at Mount Ebel
3:33:55	12835	contextually was uh the late Bronze 2 early Iron Age one
3:34:01	12841	So you know by the time I mean the conquest hadn't even
3:34:07	12847	finished when by the time Mount Eel had shut down So Mount Ebel didn't last long as a
3:34:15	12855	site it it was a really short-lived site So it wouldn't count as the high
3:34:20	12860	one of the high places in First Kings 3:2 Um in First Kings 3:2 you're already
3:34:26	12866	talking about 200 years after the
3:34:31	12871	conquest So yeah you're really not you're really
3:34:36	12876	you're really talking about other sites at this point for high places Now let's talk about what a high place
3:34:43	12883	is because there's a lot of confusion about what a high place is
3:34:48	12888	Okay high place is not a place where people worshiped pagan
3:34:54	12894	gods What a high place is is and this is not talking about elevation Okay a high
3:35:03	12903	place is not necessarily on a mountain or a hill
3:35:09	12909	It's not high in geography it's high in
3:35:19	12919	religion Okay So
3:35:24	12924	uh it's it's so we're not talking about elevation here Now we do see this language happen like
3:35:31	12931	for example when Elijah you know um you know goes from
3:35:38	12938	um Jerusalem to Hebrron Okay you know he
3:35:43	12943	is sent to descend from Jerusalem to Hebrron Well Hebron's actually higher in
3:35:50	12950	elevation but religiously he is going from the high place in a higher place religiously in
3:35:57	12957	Jerusalem to the lower place religiously in Hebron
3:36:03	12963	Okay Um or not Hebron Bethl Bethl sorry So
3:36:10	12970	um so it's it's a high place here is not talking about a place of
3:36:15	12975	elevation but it's a place of religious um uh
3:36:22	12982	service Okay Now what a high place also is though is it's aberrant
3:36:29	12989	Yahwehism Okay It's a Yahwehism It's basically people going into these
3:36:36	12996	little cult sites and worshiping selfstyled
3:36:43	13003	Yahwehism Okay
3:36:48	13008	So so basically like Shiloh Shiloh was a high place Okay It's it was a it was a cult
3:36:57	13017	site It was re- um rededicated for the for the ha tabernacle Um it's not an
3:37:04	13024	elevated site but an ele high sight in elevation but it is a cult site that's a high place
3:37:15	13035	um basically places that had their own private Yahweh temples like at Hebrron
3:37:22	13042	like at Bethl you know those are those are high places
3:37:31	13051	So it's a place where people are not necessarily it's not a place where
3:37:36	13056	Yahweh was designated to be worshiped but people decided to build temples and
3:37:43	13063	chapels to Yahweh and worship there anyway and they're doing it their own
3:37:50	13070	way So what we're talking about here when we talk about high places is selfstyled Yahweh worship
3:37:57	13077	Okay The best way to to describe it is aberant Yahwehism It's not pagan as such It's
3:38:05	13085	not polytheistic as such It's still Yahweh worship It's just Yahweh worship
3:38:12	13092	that's not following the rules Okay So I hope that helps Thank you very
3:38:19	13099	much for super chat Very much
3:38:24	13104	appreciated Okay Next one here from Daniel for $10 Thank you for the super
3:38:30	13110	chat Are there any known ancient neareastern documents which were written composed in
3:38:38	13118	a way that source critics propose the penetuk was written JP D uh plus um he's
3:38:46	13126	talking here about the documentary hypothesis um the idea
3:38:51	13131	that you had multiple sources that are then sort of mashed
3:38:58	13138	together and then redacted constantly as they're being mashed together The short answer to this is
3:39:05	13145	no There is not a single document that was ever composed this way in the
3:39:11	13151	history of mankind Okay not one I have I have at least I am unaware
3:39:19	13159	of any document that was composed this way Now let's take one that has probably
3:39:26	13166	the longest pedigree of of of transmission
3:39:32	13172	and of composition longer than the Bible Okay let's talk about the book of the dead
3:39:41	13181	because we all love talking about the book of the dead Don't open the book of the
3:39:46	13186	dead Don't open the book
3:39:52	13192	That was very well done Yeah Okay Don't Don't open it
3:40:00	13200	[Laughter] So what do we have here with the book of the dead it started off as the pyramid
3:40:07	13207	texts The pyramid texts are basically a collection of magic spells Okay so you
3:40:13	13213	do have a collection of various spells and documents there Okay they're written
3:40:20	13220	on pyramids Okay fine
3:40:26	13226	Now that then goes into the coffin text Well the basically they go into the
3:40:33	13233	pyramids copy those texts and then start copying onto to coffins Not complete
3:40:41	13241	They're not complete text on the coffins but they take samples of these and they put them on on on the coffins Okay and
3:40:50	13250	then and they change slightly over time but you know some of that is organic
3:40:55	13255	change It's not it's not say intentional redaction as such They're not redacting those texts on when they put them on
3:41:02	13262	coffins but they are modifying them in slight ways to make them more appropriate for the person in the
3:41:09	13269	coffin Okay Then they take those coffin texts and they sort of gather them together again to make the book of the
3:41:17	13277	dead And the book of the dead um is codified
3:41:24	13284	into spells again And those spells remain pretty persistent over
3:41:32	13292	time They don't change much over thousands of years
3:41:39	13299	So that's the closest parallel we have
3:41:45	13305	to a documentary hypothesis scenario That's the closest we
3:41:51	13311	got where we have one set of text that are compiled modified
3:41:59	13319	slightly and then recompiled again But there's no ongoing process of
3:42:06	13326	redaction here There's no schools of redaction I don't know I mean the whole
3:42:14	13334	idea that that I you know you got these schools of redaction of say each represented by four different schools or
3:42:21	13341	more than that Yeah There's absolutely no evidence
3:42:26	13346	of any historical document ever going through this
3:42:32	13352	process None This is all theory It's all 19th century
3:42:43	13363	theory So there's to my knowledge there's no ancient neareastern
3:42:48	13368	document that was composed in this way like the source critics propose
3:42:56	13376	So this is one of the reasons why I think that they need better evidence for their views because you know it's just
3:43:03	13383	it's all suppositional It's all hypothetical And for me that's that's
3:43:19	13399	BS Yeah It adds no value to interpretation either So
3:43:36	13416	Scott Warworth says "J Source or Sumerian anthropomorphism theme combined with Eources
3:43:41	13421	uh influence from Egypt." Yeah I I I think that's that's complete baloney Let's not misconstrue what's going on
3:43:48	13428	here without as without precedent Yeah I think that's complete baloney I I don't think that there's there's any Sumerian
3:43:55	13435	from J Source because that's that's like too archaic No I think that's that's nonsense I think that's complete
3:44:02	13442	nonsense So you know that's I mean that's ad hocing it And if
3:44:08	13448	you're going to ad hawk it Yeah Yeah I'm just going to I'm just going to shoot that down because because Yeah that's
3:44:13	13453	there's no evidence or warrant for that Just baloney
3:44:22	13462	keeps learning goes "But the documentary hypothesis is still the mainstream view in scholarship isn't it?" Um not so much
3:44:29	13469	anymore Not so much anymore Um um only in North America Okay Yeah In in
3:44:37	13477	the North America it's still the majority view Okay In Europe it's not the majority view anymore And in Israel
3:44:43	13483	it's not the majority view anymore Uh it's been pretty much supplanted by the supplementary hypothesis really the
3:44:49	13489	supplementary hypothesis is is what sort of um the is is basically given given the
3:44:57	13497	documentary hypothesis um a a
3:45:03	13503	browbeating Scott Waran goes the majority of academics side with the documentary hypothesis Of course they do
3:45:09	13509	because that's what they were taught That's what they were taught in Sarah They can't all be at Hawking Why not
3:45:15	13515	that doesn't follow No that doesn't follow at all They could all be
3:45:21	13521	wrong you know
3:45:27	13527	Yeah You know you can you can have you can have a majority view that's that's completely wrong I mean that's happened
3:45:34	13534	many times You just go look at Jericho okay for for the longest time they said
3:45:41	13541	there was no Bronze Age Jericho Well well that was Well that that aged well didn't it
3:45:48	13548	okay So you know and frankly I mean here's here's
3:45:53	13553	the thing The the problem with the documentary hypothesis has always been how do you determine what's
3:46:00	13560	redacted what's the criteria for determining a redaction that's the problem with it
3:46:09	13569	There is no objective criteria It's all subjective and it all shifts Every
3:46:15	13575	documentary hypothesis scholar has a different criteria for
3:46:21	13581	redaction You know it used to be that it was the names Oh that's where
3:46:27	13587	we get the the acronym J P and D You know you know you had the
3:46:32	13592	Deuteronomy code Well that's your D source You got your priestly code that's your P source If it used the name Yahweh
3:46:39	13599	well that's that's your J source And if it used Elohim it used that's your E source Well that was discovered to be
3:46:45	13605	complete baloney That was complete baloney So what did they do they go to another
3:46:51	13611	source instead Oh well we were going to use this method instead And then that was turned out to be baloney too Now
3:46:57	13617	it's doulets Oh anything that looks like a repetition It's got to be now evidence
3:47:03	13623	of redaction It is complete baloney Doulets Yeah Yeah The whole idea
3:47:11	13631	that if you have a a reputation of some kind or close to rep duplicate of some kind Yeah that's no that's that's
3:47:19	13639	nonsense It's utter
3:47:26	13646	nonsense Yeah Um Jonathan Walker says some duplicates are actually
3:47:33	13653	self-explan Yeah they do they do explain themselves which is why when you've got
3:47:40	13660	you know these supposed doulets I mean you've got to be careful about this
3:47:46	13666	because a lot of those have an explanation that you know does not
3:47:52	13672	require redaction you know the idea I mean a lot of them will say hey you know
3:47:58	13678	you know who who sold Joseph into slavery was the Ishelites or the Medidionites when the text clearly tells
3:48:04	13684	you that the Ishelites are Midianites So it there there's no
3:48:10	13690	warrant there for redaction And that's why I think the
3:48:16	13696	documentary hypothesis is pure baloney I have not yet seen a single
3:48:23	13703	instance where there's a compelling case of reduction Now there might be Okay and
3:48:32	13712	I'm not I'm not discounting here the updating of spellings Okay I'm not talking about spellings when I'm talking about redaction I'm talking merging of
3:48:40	13720	documents where they change the content to make it
3:48:47	13727	fit It's just oh my gosh Yeah mama Bilbo wrote some Froto
3:48:56	13736	Froto wrote some and Sam Weiss added the ending Yeah Yeah It's just no I um it is
3:49:03	13743	complete baloney It is the document hypothesis is complete baloney There is
3:49:08	13748	no ancient text that ever followed that method of of of
3:49:14	13754	construction And there's no there's no warrant for this There's no
3:49:20	13760	evidence to support this view It's complete nonsense Utter
3:49:28	13768	nonsense
3:49:33	13773	And not only that it's bad exesus
3:49:40	13780	The whole idea is based on only
3:49:46	13786	Oh yeah Oh yeah Well it follows so many logical fallacies too like the one
3:49:52	13792	person one name thing Um it it follows say uh the one place one one one toponym
3:50:00	13800	fallacy I mean there's so many of those fallacies that it employs Like I even
3:50:06	13806	heard once that the uh the two cottages in
3:50:12	13812	um uh that they're mentioned in the Bible are or a redaction to And I think
3:50:18	13818	that is just nonsense Total total
3:50:34	13834	nonsense All right let's go move on to the next super chat here
3:50:50	13850	Uh Scott adds uh J source is profoundly ancient Yeah I'm not buying it Uh way
3:50:55	13855	before the late Exodus Yeah I'm totally not buying that Much of it is written in
3:51:00	13860	sonatic What's your warrant how do you know that scribal gloss to be
3:51:06	13866	misconstrued as controversial redaction perhaps Could be Yeah that's empty
3:51:11	13871	conjecture Congratulations you win the um the Mr EC award of the night because
3:51:18	13878	that's empty conjecture Could be All
3:51:25	13885	right It'll also be written by Pink Unicorn as my producer says Could
3:51:32	13892	be All right Uh Daniel for $5 Thank you for the super chat Are there any guides

3:52:32	13952	um the early Christian doctrines and uh makes lots of reference
3:52:38	13958	to the church fathers It's a really good primer uh if you want to go into sort of
3:52:47	13967	um of of uh the church fathers and the antiian um
3:52:54	13974	writings So that's what I would recommend is is that book um Early
3:53:01	13981	Christian Doctrines by uh J&D Kelly Okay So thank you very much for the super chat Very much appreciated I hope that
3:53:14	13994	helps All right Daniel for five bucks Thank you for the super chat Where can I find more recent

3:54:10	14050	trying to remember what the series were
3:54:18	14058	Um and it's slipping my mind at the moment Uh there was a Catholic series
3:54:24	14064	that was recently done Just can't remember the name of it
3:54:30	14070	at the moment
3:54:37	14077	Um recent translations maybe in here
3:55:02	14102	There's um what what series is this yeah Catholic University Press did
3:55:10	14110	a
3:55:16	14116	series Can't remember what the name of the series is though but
3:55:21	14121	But yeah there's several translations of of the church

3:55:34	14134	and I just have to find them I might have to just say I don't
3:55:41	14141	know off the top of my head but yeah I have to probably get back to you next week on this because
3:55:51	14151	just can't seem to find it right
3:55:59	14159	now I'm going through my library here and I've got a bunch of these but I can't seem to find where I filed them
3:56:09	14169	Oh you have to kind of understand that my um my um library holdings I have
3:56:16	14176	close to 70,000 books in electronic
3:56:22	14182	format
3:56:27	14187	So so I have to um maybe that's one I can find it here
3:56:43	14203	That's a brill thing
3:57:05	14225	I do really need to go through these files and really sort them
3:57:20	14240	out I think I'm going to have to say that I can't find it right now unfortunately So
3:57:27	14247	um yeah over 70,000 books in electronic format Yeah I got a massive massive
3:57:34	14254	electronic library So mama feeling a bit envious at the
3:57:42	14262	moment I'll have to pray for God's forgiveness
3:57:48	14268	[Laughter]
3:57:53	14273	Okay Senica 70k You got to blow those numbers
3:57:59	14279	up Those are rookie numbers Yeah I lost count at
3:58:07	14287	70K Yeah I've got something like um over a terabyte of electronic books
3:58:15	14295	Okay Yeah we could do that Um yeah we can put it in the comments later So yeah
3:58:23	14303	Um Mama asks "I find myself wondering who got Kitchen's library." Ooh Um okay
3:58:29	14309	I can tell you who got Kitchen's Library No Tindale House got
3:58:36	14316	it Yep That's not as bad No No Tinddale House got Kitchen's
3:58:43	14323	Library and um I know the guy who's uh who was the executive of his
3:58:50	14330	estate So uh Tindale House got Kitchen's
3:58:56	14336	library Oh Uh that's a massive uh win for Tinddale
3:59:03	14343	House So uh the big question for me is not who
3:59:09	14349	got his library Big question for me is who got his
3:59:16	14356	photographs And um I am I'm actually going to be meeting with the executive of his will on in July I'm not in his
3:59:25	14365	will Okay So don't get I'm not getting anything of Ken's Okay Um Yeah Yeah Tinddale is still very
3:59:33	14373	legit Yeah Um yeah a lot of good research is still going on at Tinddale House So um it's it's now um um there's
3:59:42	14382	there's Tindale House and Tindale Publishers in there They've they've they're not the same anymore Um they
3:59:48	14388	used to be the same organization but they've sort of split apart So um
3:59:56	14396	um
4:00:07	14407	uh Jonathan Walker says "I tried to get a hold of a physical copy of his Tree Laws and Covenants in the Near East from
4:00:14	14414	Spain and I got a refund because it was damaged on the way." Uh that's a tricky
4:00:19	14419	book to get now That's a tricky book to get Um I have a copy of it I actually mine is was is
4:00:26	14426	autographed Um but um yeah it's it's it's it's a
4:00:32	14432	difficult book to get now Um it's also expensive Really expensive Um crazy
4:00:39	14439	expensive if you had to buy it But yeah the big question for me is
4:00:46	14446	who got his slides who got his photographs
4:00:52	14452	um cuz Kitchen had something like 40,000
4:00:57	14457	slides of of all these ramicide inscriptions in in
4:01:03	14463	Egypt And a lot of those those inscriptions don't exist anymore because they were destroyed
4:01:11	14471	So um I'm always I'm wondering who's got his photographs because it was stipulated in
4:01:19	14479	his will that those photographs were be were to be destroyed
4:01:26	14486	Okay Now um were they destroyed i hope not I really hope they
4:01:33	14493	weren't So um I'd love I'd love to know who gets
4:01:41	14501	those All right
4:01:47	14507	So well I mean he could have changed his will too at the last minute on that I hope he
4:01:54	14514	did I think I think Paul basically uh got through to
4:02:00	14520	him because because the library was also supposed to be disposed of and at any
4:02:05	14525	point I'm I'm thrilled Tinddale House got the library I hope they got the photographs
4:02:23	14543	too Yeah Okay Um Tyler X9 asks "Any
4:02:28	14548	ancient near east material on poltergeist activity?" Yes there is actually
4:02:35	14555	Um what I would recommend of um was it now um there was a actually a book on
4:02:44	14564	this Let me see if I can find it here
4:02:57	14577	Um yes Um yes there's a book on this and it's
4:03:03	14583	actually really really good
4:03:22	14602	Um find here Um oh yeah the first
4:03:29	14609	ghosts by um by Irving Finkele
4:03:38	14618	Okay Um he talks about poltergeist some that that there is um evidence of
4:03:44	14624	poltergeist activity in Mesopotamian documents Okay Objects being thrown
4:03:50	14630	around which is the the definition of of poltergeist activity Yeah Um yeah The first ghost by
4:03:58	14638	Irving Finkele That's that's the that's the source I would recommend here Yeah Um he he talks about this
4:04:06	14646	So yes there is evidence for this in the ancient near
4:04:12	14652	east So I hope that helps Thank you very much for the super chat Very much
4:04:19	14659	appreciated Okay mysterious fungus for $10 Thank you for the super chat Uh are there lines between specific
4:04:27	14667	clan begins and ends set in stone or is it more subjective like one would consider B to be part of A's clan while
4:04:35	14675	others see A and B as two clans Um okay a division of a clan can can be
4:04:43	14683	subjective Okay Um when when we talk about clans
4:04:52	14692	um clans are subdivided into clades Okay uh they don't talk about clades as much
4:05:00	14700	um but essentially a clan is divided into multiple
4:05:06	14706	clades and then clades become divide into families Okay Uh the chief tends to
4:05:14	14714	be along the main line or the main caid Okay
4:05:19	14719	So um when two clades split a a clan can divide into two two
4:05:26	14726	clans Okay So it becomes really subjective at that
4:05:33	14733	point because at that point whoever it becomes like for example if one cate has
4:05:39	14739	a member in it that becomes super famous super well-known does really really
4:05:44	14744	incredible things a new clan can be started just from that
4:05:52	14752	So so um so it's it's it's subjective when
4:05:58	14758	clans say a begin or end I mean here's the thing A clan a clan ends pretty much
4:06:06	14766	when the last member dies That's that's not a subjective ending Okay when the last member dies of
4:06:13	14773	that clan the clan ends Okay so
4:06:22	14782	Uh Jonathan Walker would the Claves be grandparents and the clan be great grandparents
4:06:29	14789	um yes it can be that but it can also be a lot further back too Uh like for
4:06:36	14796	example uh Scottish clans tend to be made of many many many clades that go
4:06:43	14803	back a thousand years Okay So um um sort of at its sort of
4:06:51	14811	shortest um um your
4:06:57	14817	greatgrandparents would be your great great grand your great grand your
4:07:03	14823	greatgrandfather can start a clan Okay because you got four generations there
4:07:09	14829	You got your great-grandfather's generation got your grandfather's generation you got your dad's generation
4:07:14	14834	and then you've got you Four generations that forms a clan right
4:07:20	14840	there Okay Now if your greatgrand uh uh father had
4:07:30	14850	multiple sons each of those families would be a
4:07:36	14856	clay underneath the greatgrandfather Okay so that's how it works Now your
4:07:45	14865	clan chief will descend down one of those clades
4:07:50	14870	usually the clay to the eldest son Usually not guaranteed but
4:07:57	14877	usually Okay so that's how it would generally
4:08:04	14884	work Now how a new clan starts is very subjective Again you
4:08:11	14891	have to have a progenitor and that progenitor is
4:08:16	14896	usually somebody who does something of note
4:08:24	14904	El Bunny is up to something All right it is midnight Yeah
4:08:30	14910	So she wants to be fed So we probably will wrap this up pretty soon here Okay
4:08:36	14916	So anyway Mysterious Fungus I hope that helped Uh starting a new clan subjective
4:08:42	14922	Ending a new clan not subjective Everyone dies Okay
4:08:54	14934	Okay BC um has a member question here Many hauntings feature ghosts of dead
4:08:59	14939	people If some of our true manifestation do you think these are actual people or
4:09:04	14944	demons masquerading okay Um that
4:09:10	14950	is there's a lot of options here Okay Um there's when we talk about hauntings
4:09:19	14959	uh uh by ghosts it's not even necessarily dead
4:09:27	14967	people There's also a whole class of hauntings by living people Okay In fact
4:09:35	14975	there was a a a a I think a threebook set of of um I have this set uh called
4:09:46	14986	ghosts of the living It talks about hauntings of spirits of people who
4:09:53	14993	hadn't died who were really alive who were still alive at the time of the haunting
4:10:01	15001	Um so there's the there's a one class of ghost that seems to not even have been
4:10:07	15007	dead yet Okay which is really weird Okay I
4:10:12	15012	have to admit that's weird But it's also really well documented too That just makes it weirder not less
4:10:19	15019	weird Okay so you've got hauntings that are from living people Then you got the dead
4:10:27	15027	people Okay Now once you talk about dead people this is where things sort of get
4:10:33	15033	hazy And I mean hazy as in there's lots of possibilities Okay You've got the
4:10:39	15039	spirits of dead people That's probably the most prosaic
4:10:44	15044	explanation You've got um engrammatic manifestations Now what's an
4:10:51	15051	engrammatic manifestation it's sort of an imprint on an
4:10:56	15056	area So think of it kind of this way It's kind of like a house that has the
4:11:03	15063	same manifestation every night and it's sort of a recording Think of it like a
4:11:10	15070	tape recording where you see a woman like here's just
4:11:16	15076	an example So you go to this old Wild West mansion and you see a woman dressed
4:11:21	15081	in a 19th century dress who walks from one end of the hall to the
4:11:27	15087	other and she does the same thing every single
4:11:33	15093	night Okay there's no you you can't talk to
4:11:39	15099	her She doesn't respond to anything It's just the same manifestation every
4:11:46	15106	night the same way It's more like a tape recording than it is a something
4:11:56	15116	interactive Um these are sort of manifestations like you see for example with shadow people Shadow people don't
4:12:03	15123	tend to interact with their environment You know they're just you
4:12:10	15130	just see it and it's just there's no interaction Yeah Mama says an echo Yeah
4:12:17	15137	it's kind of like an echo So that's another possible manifestation of ghost is not they're not a they're not a
4:12:24	15144	spirit as such but there's sort of an a sort of an imprint on reality an echo a
4:12:30	15150	shadow but there's there's nothing there Okay
4:12:37	15157	The third uh a third possibility is a manifestation by a spirit
4:12:43	15163	critter and you know this is where I say a demon or a lesser spirit will masquerade as a
4:12:51	15171	dead person Now these manifestations tend to
4:12:56	15176	be interactive They are targeting you per
4:13:03	15183	se They know you Bubble machine Princess Leia hologram Yeah Oh yeah Some of these
4:13:10	15190	some of the ghost manifestations are like Princess Leia holograms They'll say the same thing
4:13:17	15197	every time and they just
4:13:23	15203	uh Jonathan Walker an extradimensional quantum shadow Yeah it's a possibility You know it's a possibility
4:13:30	15210	Um as I said that final one where where it's a masquerading demon an un a
4:13:37	15217	familiar spirit or an unclean spirit you know they'll they will masquerade
4:13:44	15224	um um they tend to target children too That's another thing is the ones that
4:13:50	15230	are actually um masquerading a lot of them will target children or
4:13:56	15236	minors because they're vulnerable
4:14:07	15247	Um Harry Stark what even are ghosts um ghosts are a form of um apparition of a
4:14:15	15255	spirit being Okay so it's an apparition
4:14:25	15265	Um yeah it's it's it's I I think of the possibilities here I think the least
4:14:32	15272	likely possibility Um so basically what what's a ghost let's get back to what's a ghost
4:14:39	15279	Let's define this here Ghost is an apparition So it's something you
4:14:44	15284	perceive A human being perceives this as a spirit being of some kind They're not
4:14:53	15293	you They're a non-physical being that you perceive Okay so it's a ghost is
4:15:01	15301	something that could be heard or seen or felt but it's in some
4:15:08	15308	way a human being experiences a being or a remnant of a
4:15:15	15315	being that's not physically there
4:15:22	15322	Okay So that was that that that defines what we mean
4:15:30	15330	by when we're talking about ghosts Okay Now um of the of the possibilities
4:15:37	15337	we laid out here I f find that the whole idea that these are spirits of the dead to be the least compelling
4:15:44	15344	explanation All right I don't think spirits of the dead return as ghosts Okay which leaves the three other
4:15:51	15351	possibilities And I think any of those three possibilities are still sort of on the table Either they're uh spirits of
4:15:58	15358	the living They're they're basically um imprints upon
4:16:05	15365	reality or they are masquerading spirit critters I think any one of those three
4:16:11	15371	is a possibility Um but it's going to depend on the particular manifestation and the
4:16:18	15378	circumstances surrounding it So I don't think one explanation covers
4:16:24	15384	it all So I think there's a range of possibilities
4:16:32	15392	here Okay So I hope that
4:16:37	15397	um he says do you think uh I I I think that just to get back to
4:16:44	15404	the the the question here um if some accounts are true manifest I think some of those accounts are true
4:16:49	15409	manifestations Okay Hey look I've seen one I've seen
4:16:55	15415	one so I'm not willing to dismiss all of
4:17:01	15421	the accounts Yeah Yeah The Bible mentions them as
4:17:07	15427	well So are
4:17:14	15434	Yeah Yeah I Yeah It is it is part of the biblical worldview that these things exist How
4:17:21	15441	they exist is a different
4:17:29	15449	question Harry Stark says "Wow David saw a real demon." No I not say I didn't say a real demon I said I saw a ghost I saw
4:17:37	15457	a shadow man Okay Could it be a demon maybe Could it
4:17:43	15463	be an engram could be Could it be a ghost of the living could be Don't
4:17:54	15474	know Uh just Janice said "Had one masquerade as my sister Hadn't heard her
4:18:00	15480	voice for a while." That's possible Yeah If it's a masquerading it's probably a lesser a
4:18:06	15486	lesser uh a spear critter Yeah Yeah Oh yeah Oh yeah There
4:18:14	15494	was there was a time when we um um uh my wife and I had this really weird
4:18:19	15499	experience once where we dreamed the same thing and it was this very strange
4:18:25	15505	dream Um we weren't watching the same
4:18:30	15510	television cuz she was watching TV and I was off studying so for for my Mdive exams So we weren't we weren't doing the
4:18:37	15517	same activities at all But we had both had this really weird dream where our grandmothers had come up
4:18:45	15525	to us and were acting all friendly Okay
4:18:50	15530	And my wife woke up crying cuz cuz it brought brought tears to her eyes that
4:18:56	15536	you know cuz it brought back memories of her grandmother being so kind and gentle
4:19:03	15543	and it made her really miss her grandmother I I on the other hand
4:19:11	15551	wondering what what was wondering what was happening cuz my grandmother was being
4:19:19	15559	all nice and tender and caring That wasn't my grandmother My grandmother was not nice not caring not in the
4:19:28	15568	slightest My grandmother could be mean really really mean
4:19:36	15576	Okay And I'm I'm I'm waking up I'm going "What just happened
4:19:44	15584	here?" It's like "Yeah just so you do get
4:19:51	15591	manipulations like this too where a spirit critter will try to manipulate
4:19:58	15598	um a party get greedy and try to do that same thing twice
4:20:06	15606	Yeah they'll use spirit cribs will use the same script They're not they're not creative Not creative in the
4:20:14	15614	slightest So it's like um yeah they can masquerade but sometimes they they
4:20:20	15620	didn't do their research trying to prior to trying to masquerade So you know they're not
4:20:28	15628	omnisient They don't know everything I mean they got a pretty good information network because they they they've they
4:20:34	15634	know other spirit creators but um they're not perfect and they do make some serious
4:20:52	15652	mistakes Scottworth are you serious right now there's no such thing as ghosts The Battle of Babylon were just
4:20:58	15658	Marines getting spooked as they were passing by the Romans of Babylon Mine can play tricks Um no I I'm I'm dead
4:21:05	15665	serious I' I've seen one I've seen one So yes I'm
4:21:11	15671	serious and a lot of people have seen them You know and this is one of the things Irving Finkele said you know Um
4:21:19	15679	interestingly enough um um Irving Finkele started looking into this because you know he started going you
4:21:26	15686	know he started researching he found these things in the Kaoifor tablets and you know he started going to parties and
4:21:32	15692	you know he said you know I got this crazy thing I want to
4:21:37	15697	talk about and you know and and Finkele would go to
4:21:42	15702	to these high-end parties and he says "Yeah you know I I heard this story
4:21:48	15708	about about somebody you know seeing a ghost you know and and what do you think about that and he said you know you'd be
4:21:54	15714	in party six people and the sooner or later somebody in that group will come up to you and say hey you know what i
4:22:00	15720	didn't want to say this in front of the others but yeah I've seen
4:22:07	15727	one Um Harry Stark have any ghosts spirits demons been recorded on camera
4:22:14	15734	some of the activity has Okay Now that activity has always been contested Um um
4:22:22	15742	so it's it's hard to verify any recording as such Um like for example
4:22:30	15750	some poltergeist activity hasn't been recorded on camera Um I mean I've seen poltergeist
4:22:37	15757	activity myself So um again stuff flying off the shelves at West Elm
4:22:43	15763	So um you're not going to see you're more likely not to see ghosts spirits or
4:22:49	15769	demons on recording equipment Um they're not corporeal They need the human mind to be
4:22:54	15774	visible So that's not going to manifest on camera Poltergeist activity does because
4:23:02	15782	uh physical objects fly off the shelves So
4:23:08	15788	um that's that's something you're going to see Other than that though the the ghosts demons and spirits you're
4:23:13	15793	probably not going to see that on camera Okay
4:23:20	15800	So all right So let's move on here and uh do the last super chats here and then we'll call it a
4:23:29	15809	night See if we get
4:23:36	15816	there Uh are we here okay Um DWC Okay
4:23:43	15823	we've done that already Bubble machine Uh on the topic of bunnies is it
4:23:49	15829	possible for cats and bunnies to get along or do you need to keep them separate rules
4:23:55	15835	um you have to be careful with cats uh adding cats and bunnies together
4:24:01	15841	Sometimes they get along royally sometimes they don't Depends on the bunny depends on
4:24:06	15846	the cat All right But they um I would be
4:24:12	15852	more likely to trust a cat with a bunny than a dog with a bunny Okay Dogs and bunnies are are predator and prey Cats
4:24:20	15860	and bunnies can get along especially if they're similar in
4:24:27	15867	size So um there there have been a lot of successful pet owners that have combined
4:24:33	15873	cats and bunnies So it's it's it's been done very easily Um again depends on the
4:24:40	15880	size You know you get a big um big Netherland or sorry not Netherland um um
4:24:46	15886	Flemish giant and a small cat and you won't have any
4:24:54	15894	problems Uh do bunnies eat cats
4:25:00	15900	uh no but they can beat the crap out of them
4:25:07	15907	Yeah don't use a main cat If you got a main cat that's not going to be compatible with a
4:25:17	15917	rabbit Okay And we got Mortimer here with uh Milo here with some
4:25:25	15925	dinosaurs I want to thank Jack Ray for gifting the channel 20 ancient Egypt in the Bible memberships Thank you very
4:25:30	15930	much for your support of the channel We really appreciate it and it keeps food on our table and we really appreciate that too Thank you so very
4:25:37	15937	much Okay Paul for 1999 Thank you for the super chat Thoughts on the new pope
4:25:44	15944	um I don't have a lot of thoughts on the new pope Oh from what I hear is he's a moderate Uh he's going to follow along
4:25:52	15952	the lines of Pope Francis but try to respect the traditions of the church Um I it's too
4:26:00	15960	early for me to say I I he's one of those cardinals I don't know a lot
4:26:05	15965	about Um he's sort of always been sort of
4:26:11	15971	under the radar so um it's going to be really hard
4:26:16	15976	to tell Um I hope he's better than
4:26:22	15982	Francis Okay
4:26:27	15987	Um so um yeah it's going to be difficult to to to tell what what he's going to do but
4:26:35	15995	um only time will tell Okay but thank you very much for the super chat Very much
4:26:41	16001	appreciate All right Uh yeah he's the first American
4:26:47	16007	pope Uh Courtney Thompson for $2 Thank you very much for the super chat
4:26:53	16013	Joshua 10:41 and 11:16 did go move name
4:26:58	16018	appreciate all right um Joshua let's go to the text here take a look at
4:27:05	16025	this and Joshua
4:27:12	16032	10 41 and Joshua struck them at Kadesh Bernia even as far as Gaza and all the
4:27:19	16039	country of goan as far as Gibian Okay here's what we call a um duplicate
4:27:26	16046	toponym Okay and this happens It's it's not one
4:27:33	16053	name one place Okay this has never been true Okay so go didn't move but you get
4:27:41	16061	another region that's named Gan Okay and I'm suspecting that's the same for 1162
4:27:50	16070	11 16 and Joshua took all the land the hill country and all the negv and that's
4:27:57	16077	definitely in the Levant all the land of Goan the lowland the Arabah and the hill
4:28:02	16082	country of of Israel and its lowland okay yeah so again
4:28:09	16089	um this is one of those ca cases where you have um one name used of two places
4:28:16	16096	and this is not uncommon Okay Um you have a go in the Nile Delta and you have
4:28:23	16103	a go in the Levant Two places with the same name And this
4:28:29	16109	happened frequently We have multiple kades We've got I think there's in the
4:28:34	16114	Mediterranean there's 21 Antiochs
4:28:40	16120	21 So uh yeah
4:28:47	16127	three hermopouses You know this people kept reusing the same names over and over and over again So you
4:28:56	16136	know so this was very common This was very very common where people would take
4:29:02	16142	names that they were already familiar with I mean we see this even in North America You know there's like 50
4:29:08	16148	Springfields in in the United States 50
4:29:13	16153	Springfields almost one I mean one per state essentially although some states have
4:29:20	16160	two So so yeah it's it's just one of those
4:29:26	16166	things that we just have to kind of accept So I hope that helps Thank you
4:29:33	16173	very much The super chat very much appreciated And this is the final super chat of the night
4:29:39	16179	here Uh yeah mama says "America's done the same thing Check how many states
4:29:45	16185	have a Lawrence a Greenville and a Lincoln Yeah Yeah
4:29:54	16194	exactly Yeah How many lakesides are there i said Springfield Yeah I mean Springfield is
4:30:01	16201	one of the most common uh town names in the United States Yeah Yeah There's a lot more
4:30:07	16207	Springfields than uh Poison Lakes but there are a few Poison Lakes
4:30:14	16214	Yeah people ignored it too until he ended up dead Okay Jonathan Walker for $5 Thank
4:30:21	16221	you for the super chat And this is the last super chat of the night here Uh it's 12:30 already so it's probably a
4:30:26	16226	good time to end Uh he asks uh do the colors in Exodus 26:1 give us clues of
4:30:35	16235	how the cheraban were woven in an Egyptian context let's take a look at that All right
4:30:44	16244	Exodus it's a good question Exodus 26 And this is the um
4:30:50	16250	building of the tabernacle All right Exodus 26:1 Moreover you shall make the tabernacle
4:30:56	16256	with 10 curtains of fine twisted linen and blue and purple and scarlet
4:31:03	16263	material And you shall make them with them ch uh make them with cherubim the work of a skillful workman Okay
4:31:11	16271	Um the colors don't tell us a lot
4:31:17	16277	Um there's a couple ways they could have made this Uh blue and purple were
4:31:24	16284	synthetic could be obtained through cement synthetic pigments like Egyptian
4:31:32	16292	blue and Egyptian purple Okay And I do have an example of Egyptian blue right
4:31:38	16298	here Tada That's Egyptian blue And it's
4:31:43	16303	blue It's a light sky blue with kind of a It's kind of a cool blue It looks kind
4:31:50	16310	of looks warm on the screen but it's a really a cool blue Um if I take it keep it out of the the direct
4:31:58	16318	um Yeah it's sort of a robins egg blue but it's kind of um I'll keep it out of direct light here so you can kind of see
4:32:03	16323	the color better But um yeah that's about that So that's Egyptian blue
4:32:10	16330	So it's an and it's an artificial pigment and the Egyptians did make this stuff So it's possible they could have
4:32:17	16337	used Egyptian blue for this or Egyptian purple which is similar Okay Or they could have used
4:32:26	16346	um it's made from copper Yeah it's it's a copper pigment
4:32:31	16351	Yeah it's copper Uh uh it's copper combined with natron and then reduced in
4:32:40	16360	furnace Yeah it's it's a really beautiful blue It's also very ephemeral too though Unfortunately uh it fades to
4:32:48	16368	white They also could have used um turquoise They also could have taken
4:32:53	16373	turquoise and crushed it and turned that into a blue pigment as well because Egyptian blue is a synthetic replacement
4:33:00	16380	for turquoise as a pigment which is also a copper
4:33:08	16388	fault Oh yeah Oh yes Yeah You did have you did have um glass I mean this is um
4:33:16	16396	the the birth of Egyptian blue is a result of
4:33:23	16403	um first of all theance theance technology coupled with
4:33:30	16410	um glass making technology
4:33:35	16415	So so um so the the colors here Oh and scarlet
4:33:42	16422	that's from an insect Um I think it's uh was cockid something like that Red
4:33:49	16429	scarlet Yeah it's it's an insect that's uh that's crushed to make this
4:33:56	16436	pigment Yeah you have to crush a lot of them Yeah Uh mama asks "Is it UV light that makes
4:34:03	16443	it fade?" No it's actually dehydration Um it's a it's it's a it's a
4:34:09	16449	pigment that has um that's bound to six
4:34:15	16455	water uh H2O ions Okay So what happens is the um as the pigment starts losing
4:34:24	16464	water it fades to white kind of in the same way that copper sulfate copper sulfate uh when
4:34:32	16472	it's hydrris is beautiful blue crystals but when it starts losing water ions and
4:34:38	16478	becomes inhydrous it turns to white So it's more of a matter of
4:34:44	16484	dehydration that causes it to fade
4:34:49	16489	Now with that said the colors here doesn't give us a really good indication
4:34:55	16495	of of how the chair been woven but it's a great question
4:35:06	16506	Um mama asks "So if you use Egyptian blue in resin would it maintain its
4:35:13	16513	color?" That is a really interesting question And the likely answer of that
4:35:19	16519	is yes Now I would love there's an experiment I
4:35:26	16526	would love to do with this stuff which is embedded in something like resin or
4:35:33	16533	glass and then cuz one of the things is this stuff under goes infrared
4:35:39	16539	luminescence shine a red light on it and it gives off infrared radiation
4:35:48	16548	So there's a there's a possibility that if this is embedded in a say a crystal or a epoxy
4:35:55	16555	resin you could get enough uh transmission off of
4:36:01	16561	it that you could turn this into an infrared
4:36:07	16567	laser But that's a scientific geek discussion for another night
4:36:14	16574	Okay So uh so with that said
4:36:22	16582	um there's really nothing here that would give us a clue of how the um uh
4:36:27	16587	chairman were woven just from the colors alone But it's an interesting question and it's a good question Thank you very
4:36:34	16594	much for asking the question Okay Uh do we have any non-s super chats we'll take one non-s super chat if we have one If
4:36:41	16601	we don't then we'll just call it a night Just one non-s super
4:36:48	16608	chat mama Oh I'm very geeking right [Laughter]
4:36:59	16619	now Bubble machine I was enjoying geek the geeking out Yeah it's pretty cool
4:37:10	16630	Okay if we uh if we've answered everything then we'll just call it a night then I'm kind of I'm cool with
4:37:16	16636	that I'm tired and it's after midnight So and we've given them lots to geek out
4:37:22	16642	on So uh Egyptian cut the stones with lasers
4:37:29	16649	Yeah Well don't think so but uh but hey you know these there's there's things
4:37:34	16654	that have special applications today Uh like oh what was it called methylene
4:37:40	16660	blue Methylene Pew Pew A methyline blue is a
4:37:46	16666	classic dye uh that was used in microscopy uh going all about 300 years
4:37:53	16673	It was invented like 300 years ago and it's been used as a dye But methylene
4:37:59	16679	blue is laser reactive um like like liquid lasers Okay Now what
4:38:05	16685	what a liquid laser is is you put the dye in a tube and it's a liquid but you
4:38:12	16692	can stimulate that with radiation to create a laser from methylene blue and it's a um laser that's
4:38:20	16700	sometimes used in hospitals these days
4:38:27	16707	So but BC there's nothing to say they didn't use lasers Could be Could
4:38:36	16716	be All right Mama says liquid lasers Yeah there were there are liquid
4:38:42	16722	lasers There's gas lasers too Um there's a project in Scientific
4:38:49	16729	American where you could make a uh laser from automobile
4:38:56	16736	exhaust Um kind of a dangerous experiment but it was an ultraviolet
4:39:01	16741	laser You could make it using a gas tube out of automobile
4:39:07	16747	exhaust All the oxygen's gone So it was carbon monoxide and
4:39:13	16753	carbon dioxide would be so much fun Yeah so much fun to
4:39:19	16759	play with in your living room Exactly Okay so we're going to call it a
4:39:25	16765	night here
4:39:31	16771	BC how much to fun the laser making experiment i have not priced it out
4:39:36	16776	Okay All right that was fun All right Uh so we're going to call it a night here
4:39:43	16783	I want to thank all the super chatters uh who um who have uh donated generously
